<p><span class="smcap">In</span> pursuance of one leading idea, has this little
work been written:&mdash;that of giving to true merit
its due. The world is ever ready to celebrate the
achievements of its conquering heroes, who, according
to the conceptions of mankind, are noble and
great, but the patient, persevering heroism of those
in humble life, who struggle hard and suffer long, is
passed by unnoticed. Many such there are who
bear their cross of suffering in silence, and go down
to the grave with their hard fought battles and
moral victories unhonored and unsung. God and
his angels alone take cognizance of such, or it may
be, some soul who has known a life experience,
sends out a warmly gushing fount of sympathy, to
cheer these lone wanderers upon their way. It is
not the great and overwhelming sorrows of existence,
but the petty, inglorious vexations of daily life,
that most severely test the soul’s energies. They
who can meet such trials with patience and firmness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
gradually obtain the mastery, not only over circumstances,
but also over themselves and others. It is
one of the eternal laws of God that thus it shall be,
and sure it is in its fulfilment, as the promise of his
word. One thing only is needful for a complete and
glorious victory, and that is “the love that never
faileth,” “that seeketh not its own, but another’s
good.” The working of especial wonders and miracles,
the dazzling manifestations of genius, and the
great intellectual attainments which cause the world
to wonder and admire, belong only to the few, but
the power to love is a gift for all, from the highest
to the lowest, and the one thing needful is what all
may obtain. Mankind, however, are not content
with what is so common, but are continually gazing
upward for some more glorious manifestation of the
Holy Spirit, but not till the “Angels in the House”
and “The Home Spirits” are fully known and appreciated,
will the celestial beings unveil their lovely
countenances and walk with man as of old. When
human hearts have learned to live and love aright,
then will “the kingdom come.” By love alone shall
the world become regenerate and redeemed. God
speed the day then, when its reign shall be universal
and all the nations of the earth shall acknowledge
its sway!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">A WELCOME VISITOR.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a cool, clear, autumn evening, and the
full harvest-moon was pouring down a flood of
mellow light upon the hills and vallies, when the
worthy Mr. Byers emerged from the village post-office,
and made his way as fast as his age and
corpulence would permit, in the direction of “Locust
Cottage.” This was a small, low, red farmhouse,
situated in a green nook of the hills, and
at present, owned and occupied solely by an excellent
quaker lady, widely known as Aunt Nyna.
Mr. Byers was evidently in haste, but his progress
though labored, was not rapid. His short, thick
legs, did not allow of very extended strides, and
he went puffing and blowing at every few steps,
like a locomotive. The way was, however, in
reality, long, and it was with no small satisfaction,
after some fifteen or twenty minutes toilsome
walk, that he saw a bright light glimmering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
through the branches of the locusts, from the cottage
windows. Pausing one moment to take
breath, before entering the green lane which led
directly to the cottage, he drew a letter from his
pocket, and scrutinized it closely in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“That is certainly from over sea,” he muttered
to himself, “and just the one she wanted.
Lord bless her! how glad she will be!”</p>

<p>Returning it to his pocket again with a smile of
the greatest satisfaction, he continued on his way.
Instead of entering the cottage at once, as might
have been expected after such a hasty walk, he
lingered a few moments without. Stealing cautiously
beneath one of the low front windows, he
drew aside the sweet-brier that shaded it, and
looked into the room.</p>

<p>Aunt Nyna sat by her cheerful fire, reading from
a large, old-fashioned book, which lay open on the
stand before her. The house dog dozed in the
chimney corner, the tea kettle was singing on the
crane, and the little canary was fast asleep with
his head beneath his wing. No sound broke the
silence save the monotonous tick of the old clock,
faithfully numbering the moments, which to one
heart at least were full of blessing. Unconscious
that any save the All-seeing Eye was upon her,
the good lady read on, until the white muslin
handkerchief folded so neatly on her bosom was
stirred with emotion, and raising her spectacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
upon her forehead, she wiped the tears from her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Shedding tears,” muttered Mr. Byers. “Right
fortunate is it that I’m not there, for it makes a
complete simpleton of me to see a woman weep.
May be though she is thinking about him, and
wonders why he doesn’t write. I declare it is a
shame to keep her in suspense another moment,”
and he entered without further delay.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mrs. Dorothy;” he said with a
friendly familiarity.</p>

<p>“Good evening Mr. Byers. I am right glad to
see thee, for it is a long time since I beheld the
light of thy countenance. Where hast thee been
so long?”</p>

<p>“O, all about in spots, and nowhere in particular,”
replied the old gentleman, as he took his
seat in the capacious armchair which was
placed for him, and removing his hat wiped the
perspiration from his shining crown. “I just
thought, Mrs. Dorothy, as it was so pleasant to-night,
that I would call over and inquire if you
had heard anything from Harry since he left?
Let’s see&mdash;its full three months now, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Not one word as yet, Mr. Byers,” replied the
good lady sorrowfully, “and verily I had no right
to expect it before now. I had surely hoped
though that thee hadst brought me somewhat.
Yet I see I must wait a little longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Dorothy, <i>a little longer</i>.” There
was a merry twinkle in the old man’s eye as he
spoke, and his hand moved nervously in his coat-pocket,
but he looked up quickly at the row of
crooked-necked squashes hanging along the wall,
and at the bright pewter platters upon the dresser,
and composed himself. “I declare, Mrs. Dorothy,”
he continued, “how snug and comfortable you
look here! I like to see a home that <i>is</i> a home,
though I haven’t lived in one for many a year.
When my Hannah was alive I knew what true enjoyment
was&mdash;but,” he added, with solemn earnestness&mdash;“as
the poet says, ‘Now she’s dead,
and that’s all over.’”</p>

<p>“Ah me,” replied the good lady with a sigh,
“what a difference it makes to the whole of life
when one we love is taken from us! There’s a
shadow on everything ever afterwards. I remember
when my poor dear husband died I felt&mdash;“
Here she hesitated, and drew her handkerchief
from the black silk bag which lay on the table.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Dorothy,” said Mr. Byers, hastily, as he
reached for his hat, “are you about to shed tears?”</p>

<p>“Nay, friend, nay,” she replied, calmly, and
wiping her nose leisurely, she returned the handkerchief
to its place. “I was only about to say,
that after Mr. Nyna died, I felt that although I
would gladly have laid down in the grave with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
him, that I must live for Harry’s sake, and so I
lived.”</p>

<p>“A very wise conclusion, Mrs. Dorothy, yet one
that cannot be successfully carried out under all
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Ay, verily, friend; one must needs die at some
time. As I was saying, I have lived from that day
to this, and I have done all in my power to train
up that dear child in the way in which he should
go.”</p>

<p>“And I have no doubt but what he will ‘go it,’
Mrs. Dorothy,” replied the old gentleman, with
the merry twinkle in his eye again. “That is to
say, I have no doubt he will continue in the way
which you have pointed out to him.”</p>

<p>“Verily, I am of that mind myself, Mr. Byers,
for he is a good child, and it was no slight trial to
part with him.” Here her voice became choked.</p>

<p>“He was very helpful to me, and the only company
I had.” She stretched out her hand again
for her handkerchief, and Mr. Byers made a simultaneous
movement for his hat. Then, as if by
mutual and silent understanding, they both withdrew
their hands, and the good lady resumed her
knitting.</p>

<p>“I only hope and pray,” she continued, “that
he may not fall into bad company and evil ways.
Verily, it would be much better, Mr. Byers, to
hear that he was dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Very much, Mrs. Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“But O! to think of such a dreadful thing as
hearing of his death!” and there was an obvious
tremor in her voice, highly suggestive of tears.
She winked and swallowed hard, however, and
continued&mdash;</p>

<p>“I read my Bible often, Mr. Byers, and&mdash;“
Here she made a significant pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the old gentleman nervously,
as he seized the open volume from the stand; “I
have no doubt you do. Let’s see, where is it,
and what is it about?” He drew his time-worn
spectacle case from his pocket, and taking out the
big, clumsily-bowed glasses, placed them upon his
nose.</p>

<p>“It’s what the Apostle says about charity, Mr.
Byers, and I should think by the way it reads
that it was a very good thing.”</p>

<p>“Excellent! Excellent, Mrs. Dorothy, when
taken in its right sense; for look you, my good
woman&mdash;” Here Mr. Byers extended his right
hand, with the fore finger up, and regarded his
auditor over his spectacles with a look of profound
wisdom&mdash;“it’s <i>love</i> the apostle means&mdash;love of
the first quality. A kind of love, Mrs. Dorothy,
that won’t give up, not break down, nor back out,
however much it gets&mdash;gets snubbed&mdash;excuse the
word&mdash;or pestered, or imposed upon; but like
gutta percha, can be crowded into a very small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
space, or drawn out to any extent without snapping
asunder. It’s the very cream of life, Mrs.
Dorothy, mingled in with honey and the otto of
roses, and we should all be brute beasts without it.”</p>

<p>“Yea, verily,” responded the good lady, with
great earnestness.</p>

<p>“And I can truly say, Mrs. Dorothy, that if
these words were all that my Bible contained, I
would not part with it for the wealth of the Indies;
for is it not a comfort, in this crooked and cross-grained
world, to find something that will not fail
us? We can’t all be Daniels or Isaiahs, or have
the wisdom of Solomon or Paul, but the simplest
one among us knows how to love. Prophecies shall
fail, and knowledge vanish away, but charity <i>never</i>
faileth. Mrs. Dorothy, I’ll thank you for a glass
of water.” No sooner had the good lady arisen to
comply with her visitor’s request, than Mr. Byers
drew the letter from his pocket, slipped it between
the leaves of the Bible at his favorite chapter, and
closing the volume, laid it upon the table.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Dorothy. It is not often
that I preach a sermon, but when I do, it is because
the spirit moves me, as your people say, and
this portion of Scripture in particular, always
loosens my tongue and puts words into my mouth,
whenever I am reminded of it. I would not like
to intrude anything more upon your notice at
present, but I do wish, my good woman, that after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I am gone, you would look at the preceding chapter,
and see what an excellent preface it forms to
the Apostle’s remarks on charity.” Mrs. Dorothy
reached immediately for the volume, but Mr. Byers
laid his hand upon it.</p>

<p>“Not now, if you please. The Apostle first goes
on at some length to speak of the supernatural
powers and miraculous gifts of the times, which
caused the whole world to wonder, and exalted
those who were thus favored, almost to the rank
of gods. Yet, even while confessing that such
things were by all means desirable, and to be
sought after most diligently, he says, ‘Covet earnestly
the best gifts; and yet show I unto you <i>a
more excellent way</i>.’ Then he goes on at once to
his unequalled discourse on charity&mdash;a simple
thing in itself, which you, and I, and the smallest
child among us can possess if we will, and which
shall make us of more worth in the eyes of God
and his angels, than all the professors and doctors,
and wonder-workers, that the world ever knew.
It is beautiful, Mrs. Dorothy! beautiful!” and the
enthusiastic old man rubbed his hands together,
with an expression of great inward satisfaction, as
he rose to depart.</p>

<p>“I must go now,” he continued, glancing at the
clock, “for it is about eight, and I have several
more calls to make. Doubtless you will hear from
Harry before long, so don’t be discouraged. Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
read your Bible and trust in the Lord, and
above all things, don’t forget to look this very
night at the chapter which I mentioned. You will
find something there worth thinking about, and
excellent to sleep upon.”</p>

<p>“Yea, verily, I will, friend,” replied the good
lady, “and I thank thee much, also, for thy pleasant
discourse, although my disappointment at not
hearing from Harry has somewhat troubled and
confused me.”</p>

<p>“And what would you have done, Mrs. Dorothy,
if, upon my entrance, I had taken a big letter
at once from my pocket, directed in Harry’s own
hand, with a foreign post-mark upon it?”</p>

<p>“Done, Mr. Byers! I should have shed tears of
gratitude and joy over it.”</p>

<p>“Very likely; and this is exactly the reason
why I should not like to be such a messenger.
Good night, Mrs. Dorothy.” After the door closed
behind him, Mr. Byers did not proceed directly on
his way. Once more he stopped beneath the window,
and looked through the overshadowing vines
into the room. He saw the good lady re-seat herself
by the stand, open the sacred volume, and
then heard her quick, joyful exclamation of surprise.
It was quite enough for him. Smiling;
and rubbing his hands with heartfelt satisfaction,
he bent his steps down the lane, in search of some
other place and opportunity for the exercise of his
active benevolence and ready sympathies.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE “LITTLE WIFE.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">“Come</span> hither, Bose,” said Aunt Nyna, shortly
after the departure of Mr. Byers, “I am minded
to talk with thee.”</p>

<p>The faithful old house dog, who lay dozing in
the chimney corner, opened his eyes sleepily and
drew a long breath. He rose up, and shaking his
rough coat, came and sat down beside his mistress&mdash;rested
his fore paws upon her knees, and
gazed up into her face with a knowing, expectant
look.</p>

<p>“I am mindful that thou art but a poor, dumb
beast, without a soul,” continued the good lady,
“yet nevertheless, as I have no other friend in
my loneliness, I would fain speak with thee. Dost
thee remember Master Harry, Bose? and dost
thee know, too, that here I have a letter from him&mdash;the
first since he left us three months agone?
Look at it, poor creature! It is brim-full of hope
and affection, and there are even words of kindly
remembrance for thee, which would make thy
old heart leap for joy, could they be spoken in his
own cheery tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>She held the closely written sheet before the
face of her faithful companion, but he only winked
at it with an unconcerned look, as any dog might
be expected to do. Suddenly, however, he started
up, wagging his tail, scented the letter keenly,
and rubbed his head against it, with a quick, low
cry.</p>

<p>“Lord bless his dear old heart,” exclaimed the
good lady, with a gush of tears. “He knows all
about it. What wonderful gifts the good Lord has
bestowed upon his dumb creatures! and she
glanced up reverently, with clasped hands, in silent
acknowledgment of the wisdom and goodness
of the Creator. Again and again did she read
over this welcome missive from the only remaining
one of the little band which had once gathered
around her. Then she placed it once more as a
sacred keep-sake between the lids of the Bible,
and folding her hands meekly, leaned back in her
chair. Her face was turned towards the window,
where she could see the clear moonlight falling
upon the hills and corn-fields&mdash;the locust trees
and vines which grew by the cottage waving in the
wind, and far out beyond, the village church, with
the little grave-yard about it, and the white stones
gleaming in the moonlight. Then the faces of
her loved and lost, whose mortal remains lay
buried there, seemed to look kindly down upon
her with the faces of angels, and as they faded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
away she sank into a deep and quiet slumber.
As she sat thus, the door was gently opened, and a
young girl entered&mdash;a fair, round-faced girl, with
rosy cheeks and bright eyes. She wore a checked
handkerchief tied over her head&mdash;a little
brown sack&mdash;a short striped dress&mdash;blue stockings
fitting very closely to her legs, and stout
leather shoes. Bose raised his head quickly, but
upon seeing who it was, he got up and wagged his
tail as if she were an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Good evening, aunty,” said the girl in a cheerful
tone.</p>

<p>“Bless me!” exclaimed the good lady, starting
up&mdash;“Why Hesper! is it thou? Verily, I was
almost, if not quite asleep. Come to the fire dear
child and warm thee. I hope thou hast brought
thy work, and will sit with me awhile.”</p>

<p>“No, aunty,” she replied, as she knelt down by
the fire and rubbed her little ruddy hands together,
“I have come to you in trouble, and must fly
away home again as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Trouble, Hesper?” repeated the good lady
with a look of concern, “what is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, aunty, just before dark, as father
was at work in the mill, a large bar of iron fell
upon his foot, and crushed it badly. He was so
faint he could not stand, and Capt. Clark brought
him home in his wagon.”</p>

<p>“Dear! dear! that is a great pity! And dids’t
thou send for the doctor, Hesper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“No; mother wished to, and so did I, but father
would not listen to us. He said doctors always
charged so much that it was like giving them
the bread out of the children’s mouths. Poor
Mose has been hard at work all day, and now he
must take father’s place to-night.”</p>

<p>“To-night! what for?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; you know that Mose works days
and father nights. Mose was just about leaving,
when father hurt him, and as Mr. Brown, the
overseer, said that he must have a man in his
place, Mose was obliged to stay.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mose! it is really too bad,” said Aunt
Nyna, sorrowfully. “He begins to stoop and look
almost as old as his father. He has altogether too
much hard labor for one so young. How old is
he, Hesper?”</p>

<p>“He was seventeen last month.”</p>

<p>“Only seventeen! poor soul! and he does as
much work as any man, without fretting or finding
fault either.”</p>

<p>“No; he never says one complaining word, and
is just as ready to lend me a helping hand about
the house, when he comes home, as if he had
done nothing at all. I wish he <i>did</i> talk more, for
sometimes, when father complains and finds so
much fault, and all the time Mose is so good and
patient, I long to throw my arms about his neck
and tell him how much I love him. But then we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
children are not used to doing such things, and I
am afraid he would think me a very silly girl. So
I do what is next best&mdash;I knit stockings for him,
mend his old jacket as well as I can, and have his
supper all nice and hot for him when he comes
home.”</p>

<p>“Heaven help thee, Hesper!” piously ejaculated
the old lady, “thou hast many trials, but thou
may’st be sure while trying so hard to do well,
that God will bless thee.”</p>

<p>“He does bless me, aunty, for I have a thousand
things to make me happy. But I mustn’t stop to
talk with you any longer. I only ran over to see
if you could spare me a few of your green wormwood
leaves to bruise into a salve for father’s foot,
as mother says if he won’t have a doctor, that is
the best thing which can be done for him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it is,” said Aunt Nyna,
“Though I verily fear he will repent it sorely if
he does not have proper care in the first place.”
She took down her old shawl from the peg in the
corner, and wrapping it about her, they went out
into the little garden in the rear of the cottage.
The moon shown so brightly they could easily find
the bed of herbs, in the centre of which grew the
great wormwood root.</p>

<p>“I had almost forgotten to tell thee, Hesper,”
said Aunt Nyna, as they were gathering the
leaves, “that I have had a letter from Harry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“From Harry!” exclaimed the girl, in a tone
of joyful surprise. She let go of the plant at
once, and sitting down flat upon the ground, looked
up to the good lady with an expression of eager
expectation.</p>

<p>“Yea, darling! a letter from Harry, this very
night; and he said&mdash;well he said so much that I
scarce know what first to tell thee.”</p>

<p>“Was he well and happy, aunty? and does he
remember us all, and mean to come back so soon
as he is able?”</p>

<p>“Yes; all that and more: but very particularly
he says&mdash;’Tell my little wife,’ just as he always
called you Hesper&mdash;’that I don’t like the looks
of the Chinese ladies at all, and that I think more
of her every day I live. That I shall work hard
to earn all the money I can, and when I come
back shall take her&mdash;if she is willing&mdash;to be my
little wife in reality.’”</p>

<p>Hesper laughed merrily&mdash;“that is just like
Harry,” she said. “But, aunty,” she added in a
graver tone, “father said, a short time ago, that
he didn’t like it at all that Harry should call me
his little wife. He said it was only putting foolish
notions into children’s heads, which would get
there soon enough without any assistance. Mother
told him that she didn’t see any particular
harm in it, and I never shall forget how he looked,
or what his words were when he answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>.”
“‘Susan,’ said he, ‘perhaps <i>you</i> think so, for
every woman who has made a fool of herself, is
perfectly willing that another should do so. Now-a-days,
the boys and girls are brought up to think,
that to get married is all they live for, and that if
they can cheat one another into it, they are remarkably
fortunate; but when a few years have
passed by, and the cares of the world are fairly upon
them, they will wish they were in their graves,
with all that belong to them.’ Mother looked
very sad when he said this, and I saw her slyly
wipe the tears from her eyes. It made me feel so
sorrowful that I didn’t know what to do, and so,
when there was a good chance, I stole up into my
chamber, and kneeling down I prayed with all my
heart, that I might die before I was old enough to
marry, or if I could live, that I might be kept
from doing anything so wrong and foolish.”</p>

<p>“Nay, my child,” said the good woman, with
much earnestness, “that is not right. I am
sorry to say that thy father always looks on the
dark side of life, but verily, there is a bright one
also. It may be that he is right in thinking that the
young people have very foolish notions about such
things, now-a-days, but that is mostly the fault of
their elders. Every sensible father and mother
should tell their children, so soon as they are old
enough to understand, of the great duties that life
has in store for them&mdash;that they are growing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to be men and women&mdash;it may be, husbands and
wives, fathers and mothers, and therefore they
should keep their bodies pure, sound and healthy,
and store their minds with useful knowledge, so
they may be able to act faithfully and wisely in
whatsoever situation they may be placed. Then
there would not be so many mistaken marriages as
there are now, and those who do marry, would be
far happier. Yea, Hesper, I am not afraid to say
to thee, young as thou art, that it is a solemn
thing to become a wife, and God grant thou
may’st never take that step, without thinking well
about it in the first place.”</p>

<p>“No, aunty,” replied Hesper, with a serious
countenance and a decided shake of her head, “I
never shall marry. I am sorry Harry ever called
me his little wife, and you must write to him not
to do so any longer, for I never shall be <i>his</i> wife
or any one’s? I only want to be a good woman,
and stay at home and take care of father and
mother.”</p>

<p>“Well, child, thou hast indeed a thoughtful
head, but thee knows little as yet of the world,
and the experiences of life. I only pray that thy
heart may ever keep in its child-like purity,
and be preserved from the blight and mildew of
misplaced affection.”</p>

<p>Thus they went on talking, as they slowly gathered
the leaves, without thinking how fast time
flew, until they had obtained a sufficient quantity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear me, aunty,” exclaimed Hesper, as she
rose up to depart, “I am afraid I have quite
spoiled one of your beautiful herbs, for I have
trampled directly over it, and should not have
thought it anything more than grass, had it not
been for its strong and pleasant fragrance.”</p>

<p>“O, there is no harm done,” said Aunt Nyna,
“it is only my camomile root, which is not easily
hurt, for, like a good Christian, the more it is
trampled upon, the greater is the fragrance and
the better it grows.”</p>

<p>“Why, what a good-natured thing!” said Hesper,
laughing. “I must carry some of the leaves
home with me to put under my pillow. Then I
may dream of it, and perhaps grow just like it.”</p>

<p>As they passed along through the garden, aunt
Nyna gathered some fine, ripe peaches, and gave
them to Hesper for her mother. “How is thy
mother to-night?” she asked.</p>

<p>“O, she doesn’t seem to get any better, and
sometimes I think,” continued the girl sorrowfully,
“that she never will.”</p>

<p>“Aye, well, it isn’t best to be discouraged,”
said aunt Nyna, cheerfully, though at the same
time she felt that the poor girl had great reason to
be so.</p>

<p>The fact was, that Hesper’s mother had been
ill for a long time, and during the last six months,
had been confined entirely to her bed. Hesper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was only fifteen years of age, and quite small at
that, but being the only daughter in a large and
poor family, she had been obliged to think and
care for others early. Until the past year she had
attended school, and learned very fast, but now,
the sickness of her mother made it necessary for
her to remain at home. Her loving heart and
cheerful disposition made her as quick to learn in
one place as another, and she soon became quite
an accomplished little house-keeper. All the
neighbors wondered at her readiness and ability,
and her aunt Betsey, who was very particular and
hard to please, declared that Hesper would make
a real nice woman, if she lived long enough.</p>

<p>“I sometimes think,” said Hesper, “that mother
might get better if she didn’t worry so much
about poor little Johnny; but she lies there in
bed, and watches him as he eats his bread and
milk in the chimney corner, or sits with his playthings
on the floor, and she sighs often, as she
says&mdash;’Poor child! what would become of you if
I should be taken away!’ O, it makes my heart
ache, and I feel as though I should cry.”</p>

<p>“It is sad, very sad,” said aunt Nyna.</p>

<p>“Mother says,” continued Hesper, “that for
many years she kept thinking he would come out
bright at last, but there’s no use hoping for that
any longer. Although he is ten years old now,
yet he cannot speak a single word, and is just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
much pleased with his little playthings, as when
he was an infant. Poor Johnny,” she added,
thoughtfully, “he is a simple child, but I know he
loves me, and if mother should die, I would sooner
beg from door to door, than see him suffer.”</p>

<p>As they were talking together, they passed out
through the garden gate, and continued down the
lane, till they came to the bridge over the brook.
Here with many a word of affection and encouragement,
they parted. Aunt Nyna returned to
her cottage, and Hesper scampered up the winding
road by the old wind-mill, in the direction of
her home.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">HESPER AND HER FATHER.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Mr. Greyson,</span> the father of Hesper, sat in his
high-backed chair, looking pale and very much
distressed. His foot rested upon a pillow in the
chair before him, and he groaned as if in great
pain. The fire had gone out on the hearth, and
the only light in the room was from a tall candle
which flickered and flared, making great dancing
shadows on the wall, and gleaming fitfully across
the face of the sick woman who lay upon the bed.
Simple Johnny, the poor child of whom we have
spoken, sat in the chimney corner, sobbing and
crying as though his heart would break.</p>

<p>“Hush, hush!” said his father impatiently; but
the poor child vainly strove to suppress his grief.
It was but for a moment, and then it burst forth
afresh. One could not wonder much, however,
when the cause was known. The little porringer
of bread and milk which Hesper had given him
just before she went out, by an unlucky slip was
overturned upon the hearth, and Fido&mdash;a little
black dog, with drooping ears and white feet&mdash;was
lapping it up in greedy haste. This was indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a serious misfortune. The supper of the
children usually consisted of bread and milk, and
as it was portioned out in equal shares, therefore
what was lost could not be easily replaced. His
supper, moreover, was one of the great events in
this poor child’s daily experience. His porringer
of bread and milk, his wooden horse and tin
soldiers, with now and then a run in the fields to
gather flowers, made up his whole round of enjoyment.
The loss of a richly freighted ship could
not have more seriously affected a prosperous merchant,
than did that overturned porringer of bread
and milk to this poor, simple child.</p>

<p>“Do hush, Johnny dear!” said his mother in a
gentle tone, when she saw how much it worried
her husband. But the child could not be pacified.</p>

<p>“Strange!” said his father impatiently, “that
he couldn’t have been taught to mind better. If
he had been constantly under <i>my</i> eye for ten years,
it would have been different.” His wife sighed
heavily as she sank down again upon her pillow,
but made no reply. Just then, in came Hesper,
all out of breath with running.</p>

<p>“Well,” said her father, “I hope you have
stayed long enough. I wonder if you ever think
of anybody but yourself when you are away.”</p>

<p>Hesper did not reply. Her father did not like
to be answered when he was impatient, and he was
uncommonly so to-night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have a nice parcel of leaves,” she said pleasantly,
as she unrolled her apron and displayed
them.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he replied, “put them down, and
stop that child’s crying as soon as possible, or send
him to bed.”</p>

<p>To Johnny, his father’s last words, which he
perfectly understood, were a most unwelcome
sound, and he cried louder than ever.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” said Hesper, as she discovered
the cause of his grief&mdash;“no wonder he cries. He
has lost nearly all of his supper. How luckily
things do happen sometimes,” she thought to herself.
“Here I have been so busy that I had quite
forgotten my own supper; now Johnny shall share
it, and right welcome.” She poured the greater
part of the milk out of her own bowl into the porringer,
and as she gave it into his hand the glad
smile which lit up the troubled countenance of
the poor child, and shone through his tears, was
worth more to her than victuals and drink. The
next thing she did was to kindle a fire and prepare
the salve. When it was ready she spread it upon
a nice linen cloth, and laid it on the hearth, while
she unbound her father’s foot, for it had been
bathed and wrapped up nicely, before. Her little
sympathising heart was full of compassion for him
the moment she beheld it. No wonder he groaned
and was so impatient!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“May be,” thought Hesper, “I should make a
much more noisy complaint if it were myself.”
She handled it very carefully, but her father worried
and fretted so, that her hands trembled violently,
and she was afraid that she was hurting far
more than helping him.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, when she had finished, “I’m
glad you are done. I don’t believe it will do one
bit of good.”</p>

<p>Hesper was quite disheartened, but she said
nothing. She moved the little pine table up to the
fire, placed the candle upon it, and sat down to
her work. She was making a shirt, of stout,
coarse cloth, for Mose. It was the first time she
had ever attempted to make one, and she was
doing it now by her mother’s direction. It was
nearly finished, and her fingers flew very fast, for
she thought that when her aunt Betsey came in
next morning&mdash;as no doubt she would&mdash;she
would show it to her, and tell her she had made it
all herself. She was not afraid to do so, for she
knew that she had taken pains enough to please
even aunt Betsey.</p>

<p>Mr. Greyson sat very still, with his head laid
back in his chair, and his eyes almost closed.
Hesper supposed he was asleep, but he was not.
He was watching her and thinking very earnestly
about her. So much had his mind been occupied
by work and family cares of late, that he had scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bestowed a thought upon her. Now, when he saw
how small she was, and then remembered how
much she did every day, he wondered that it was
possible. Then, too, she looked so cheerful and
good-natured, with her hair parted so smoothly on
her forehead, and her face bent down to her work,
all glowing with pleasant thoughts. His heart
was drawn towards her, and he began to be sorry
for the impatient words he had spoken. Then he
observed, also, her little, short, faded frock, and he
wondered how long she had worn, and where she
had obtained it. Certainly he had not bought her
a dress for more than a year, and where she had
obtained that one was a mystery. He did not
know that she had often sat up late at night to
patch and mend it, and that when, at last, the
waist and sleeves had given out entirely, she was
obliged to put on her little brown sack and wear it
constantly, to cover all deficiencies. His own
trials had seemed so great that he had little sympathy
to spare for his children. This poor girl,
therefore, had been obliged to bear her own little
cross of self-denial in silence, while the saddening
influences of her father’s gloomy disposition, cast
a continual shadow across her sunshine.</p>

<p>She had not the slightest idea at present, however,
that he was observing her; for while her fingers
flew so swiftly, her mind was busy with plans
for the future. At precisely half-past nine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
shirt was completed, and as she held it up, she
viewed it with the greatest satisfaction. Had it
been the most exquisite piece of embroidery, it
could not have afforded her a more heartfelt pleasure.
She folded it up neatly, and then turned
her attention to Johnny. The happy little fellow
had eaten every drop of his bread and milk, and
then fallen asleep. His head rested wearily against
the wall, and just then there was such a beautiful
and peaceful expression to his countenance, that
Hesper felt unwilling to disturb him.</p>

<p>“May be,” she thought, “he is dreaming of the
angels, and what a pity it will be for me to bring
him back from their blessed company.” She lightly
raised the golden ringlets from his round, fair
cheeks, and regarded him with a look of intense
interest. To this thoughtful girl there had always
been an unfathomable mystery in the silence which
brooded over the soul of her unfortunate brother.
She felt, without understanding, that there was
something, away down in the depths of his being,
quietly waiting its own due time for utterance, and
until that time came, he must remain a simple,
inexperienced child. At times, a strange feeling
of wonder and religious awe would come over her,
as she regarded him, for an almost angelic expression
would sweep across his countenance, and in
his large, blue eyes, there would be such a deep
and tender light, that it almost made her weep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
She looked upon him as something holy, and in
return, the child attached himself to her with an
affection which knew no change or diminution.
To-night he had sat up unusually late for him, and
now his slumber was so deep and quiet, that she
found it very difficult to arouse him. He did not
resist her, however, as she raised him up tenderly
and undressed him; for he was so heavy with sleep
he could scarce stand, and really did not know
when Hesper tucked up his bed and gave him a
good-night kiss. The poor girl herself was very
tired, but she had one more duty to perform, which
to her was always pleasant. She drew up the little
table, and taking a book from the drawer, seated
herself upon the side of her mother’s bed.</p>

<p>“Read quite low,” said her mother, “so as not
to disturb your father.” They both thought he
was asleep, but he heard every word they said.
Hesper read on very slowly and thoughtfully, till
she came to the words, “Charity never faileth.”
Aunt Nyna had spoken to her of this particular
chapter while they were together in the garden,
and therefore she had selected it.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she said, as she laid down the book,
“I think love <i>does</i> fail, sometimes, for I have tried
very hard to love and please father, but he never
likes anything that I do.” Her mother sighed
deeply, and the tears came into her eyes, as she
looked up in the face of the good child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“It don’t mean <i>that</i>, Hesper. Love often fails
in what it attempts. But it <i>does</i> mean, that under
all difficulties or discouragements, true love
never fails or grows weary, but remains the same
forever and ever. It is just like God himself.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Hesper, as she glanced towards her
father, “I will not mind it much if he doesn’t love
me, for it will make me very happy if in one little
thing I can be like God.”</p>

<p>“Your father wasn’t always so, Hesper,” said
her mother, as the tears streamed down her pale
cheeks. She turned her face over into her pillow,
and while Hesper was finishing the chapter, she
thought of the first years of their wedded life.
Then her husband was strong and healthy, and they
had a little cottage of their own, with holly-hocks
blooming by the door, and roses at the window.
Next came long years of suffering and sorrow,
when both were broken down in health and spirits,
and they had not bread enough to fill the little
hungry mouths that cried out for it. No wonder
he became gloomy and sad, and said at times that
his children would be better off in their graves.
It was no uncommon thing. Thousands of poor
men had felt just so before him. Only the brave
heart of a Christian can bear poverty cheerfully.</p>

<p>Hesper had finished reading some time, and sat
waiting for her mother to speak, but as she did
not, she supposed she was asleep. “Good night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
mother,” she whispered, for it was a comfort to
the tender-hearted child to speak the words, even
though they were not heard. Her mother raised
her head.</p>

<p>“Good night,” she replied, and putting her
arms about Hesper’s neck, she kissed her.</p>

<p>Mr. Greyson turned away his face quickly, for
he was heart-stricken at what he had heard, and
he could not bear to see their mutual love. The
next moment Hesper passed him on her way to
her chamber, and he longed to call her back and
speak kindly, but something, he knew not what,
restrained him.</p>

<p>It was not till the poor girl sank down upon her
pillow, that she was conscious of being very weary.
Her head ached with thinking, and her limbs
with long continued action; but it was a sweet
consolation to know that she had done all her
duty. The moon shone in at the little window
near the foot of her bed, and as she looked out,
she could see the top of “Cottage Hill” covered
with neat white houses and finely cultivated gardens.
Beyond this was the “Rolling Mill,” where
her father and Mose worked. The noise of the machinery
could be heard at a great distance, and
day and night the red flames were pouring constantly
from the tops of the tall chimnies. As
Hesper was watching this, a thought came to her
suddenly. “Why!” she exclaimed, as she started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to her feet in an instant&mdash;“Poor Mose hasn’t
had a morsel of supper!” In a few moments she
was dressed and went softly down stairs. Her
father still sat in his great chair with his eyes
closed, but even then he was not asleep. She
stole very gently into the pantry, and wrapped up
some broad slices of bread and meat which were
left from her father’s supper. Then she warmed
some tea and poured into it the last drop of milk
from her own bowl, of which, as yet, she had not
tasted. When all was ready she wrapped her
mother’s great shawl about her, and carefully
unbolted the door.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said her father, “where are you
going?”</p>

<p>She was very sorry he had heard her, for she
feared he would not allow her to go out so late at
night.</p>

<p>“Only to carry Mose some supper, if you
please, sir,” she said very meekly. “Poor Mose!
I am afraid he will faint before morning, if he
does not have some.”</p>

<p>“That is right; you are a good girl, Hesper,”
he said in a pleasant tone.</p>

<p>O, how those few, gently spoken words made
her heart throb, and with what joyful tears in her
eyes did she spring from the door-step! Never
had she known him to speak so kindly before, and
her whole affectionate nature was drawn towards
him in a moment.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">MOSE.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Hesper</span> was quite at a loss what to do, when she
came to the great door of the Rolling Mill. The
dress of the workmen&mdash;the red light shining on
their faces&mdash;the dazzling brightness from the furnaces,
and the deep, gloomy blackness of the more
remote parts of the building, all appeared so wild
and strange, that she dared not enter. Every few
moments the doors of the furnaces would be raised,
and a large, glowing mass of red hot iron
taken out, which was drawn quickly between rollers
of various sizes. Great showers of sparks
flew in all directions, and the voices of the workmen
had a strange, unnatural sound as they shouted
to one another amid the roar and din of the
ponderous machinery. Hesper quite despaired of
ever finding Mose amid all this confusion, and she
longed to see some one of whom she could inquire.</p>

<p>“What’s that, over in the corner yonder?” said
one of the workmen to another, pointing towards
Hesper.</p>

<p>“Well,” said his companion, after a moment’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
pause, “I am not quite certain, but if it wasn’t so
late, I should take it to be a little girl.”</p>

<p>“Some stray child, I suppose,” said the first&mdash;“I’ll
go speak to her.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish for anything, my little maid?”
he asked kindly.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” said Hesper, curtseying, “can you
tell me where my brother, Moses Greyson is?”</p>

<p>“I will see,” he replied, and he went to Mr.
Brown, the overseer.</p>

<p>“Follow me, my little lady,” said Mr. Brown,
“and I will point him out to you. The poor fellow
was pretty well tired, and I told him he had better
rest awhile.”</p>

<p>They went out of the mill, and passed along the
borders of the stream, by which the machinery
was turned.</p>

<p>“There he is, yonder,” said Mr. Brown, and as
Hesper looked in the direction in which he pointed,
she saw Mose sitting upon a log near the mill-dam.
She thanked Mr. Brown as he left her, and
then stole up softly behind her brother. He had
an old coat thrown over his shoulders&mdash;his elbows
rested upon his knees, and his face was
covered with his hands.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” thought Hesper, “how tired
and hungry he must be!” She gathered up her
great shawl, and then clasped her arm closely
about his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you thinking about, Mose?” she
said cheerfully, as she laid her warm cheek against
his.</p>

<p>“Why Hesper!” he exclaimed, in perfect astonishment,
“in the name of all that is wonderful
how came you here.”</p>

<p>“To bring you some supper, Mose,” she replied,
as she displayed her little tin pail, and roll
of bread and meat.</p>

<p>“That is just like you,” said Mose. “You are
the most thoughtful girl in the world.” There
was such a choking sensation in his throat, he
could not say another word. If he hadn’t been a
great boy he would have cried outright. A few
moments before, he was feeling perfectly wretched
for he thought that everybody in the world had
forgotten him. But even then, that dear, good
girl, was trudging all alone over the hills, to bring
him some supper, and now was sitting upon the
log beside him, with her sweet little face close to
his. “Who wouldn’t love such a sister,” he
thought, and he longed to say so, but just then he
dared not trust his voice to speak.</p>

<p>“Do eat it now,” said Hesper, “and drink the
tea while it is hot, it will do you so much good.”</p>

<p>He did not wait for a second invitation, but ate
and drank with a good relish, for he was faint
with hunger.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, as he swallowed the last morsel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
“that has done my very heart good, and I
cannot tell you how much better I feel than I did
ten minutes ago. I am glad you came just as you
did, Hesper, for I was thinking that if I should
jump into the stream here, all my troubles would
soon be over, and I should rest forever.”</p>

<p>“O Mose! Mose! what a dreadful thing!” exclaimed
Hesper.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, laughing, “I didn’t really
mean to. I was only thinking about it. But I
don’t feel so now. I want to talk to you, Hesper,
now that I have the chance&mdash;I long to lay open
my whole heart to you, but I am afraid you will
think me very selfish if I do.”</p>

<p>“No, no Mose,” said Hesper, “I can never
think that of you, for when I have seen <i>you</i> so
good and patient, it has given <i>me</i> greater courage
to persevere. You seem nearer to me, Mose, than
any of the others, because you and I have a great
many hard things to bear. But aunt Nyna tells
me that if we are patient, we shall be all the
stronger and better for it when we grow older, and
I believe it, for she has met with a great many
sorrows in life, and yet there is no one more
cheerful.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mose proudly, “if a little girl
like you has so much courage, I am sure I ought to,
but when I see the advantages that other boys
possess I can’t help longing for something better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I want to <i>know</i> more&mdash;I want to see more of the
world, and I want to earn money enough to make
us all comfortable, for it is killing me to drudge
along so day after day, merely to get food and
clothing, and not have one moment for thought or
enjoyment. Hesper, it is too hard, though I never
said so before.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what you <i>could</i> do,” said Hesper,
sorrowfully. He drew an old book from his pocket.
It looked very much worn and tumbled. The
covers were loose, and the leaves soiled and torn
down at the corners. It was the old Geography
he had formerly studied in school.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he continued, “every moment of
my leisure time I have spent over this old book,
until I can repeat almost the whole of it. Now,
Hesper, if I could only go to sea, I could do all I
wish. I long to be away on the broad ocean,
where I can grow strong and healthy. I think of
it all day and dream of it at night. Sometimes,
when I have done work, I have gone away by myself
far along the beach, where the waves came
rolling in from the open sea. There I have seen
the great merchant ships pass by with their sails
all set, and their flags streaming in the breeze. I
have watched them till they have been lost, quite
lost in the distance, and then, as I have thought
of the different ports to which they were bound,
of the wonderful cities and strange people they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
visited, I have indulged in so many useless longings,
that sometimes I have wept like a child. O,
Hesper! if it were only possible!” Hesper was
astonished, for she had never heard Mose say so
much before. But he had quite taken her heart
into his own, and now she felt there was nothing
in the world so desirable as that Mose should go to
sea. She did not once think of the sad loss it
would be to the family, or of her own loneliness.
It was enough that he <i>wanted</i> to go, and she felt
that he <i>must</i>.</p>

<p>“I believe it <i>is</i> possible,” she said with the utmost
confidence, though she was sure she couldn’t
tell why. Mose shook his head sorrowfully&mdash;“I
don’t see how, said he&mdash;father is not strong as he
used to be&mdash;mother is sick, and Fred and Charlie
are too young to do anything useful. I feel that I
<i>must</i> stay at home, though I should die at my post.
Besides, there is no one to help me.”</p>

<p>Hesper was silent, but her heart was full of sympathy.
She glanced down at the foam-covered
stream as it fell over the dam and dashed boldly
over every obstacle. Then she raised her eyes
to the cloudless heavens, where the stars were
shining brightly and the full moon looked kindly
down upon her.</p>

<p>“<i>God</i> will help us,” she said earnestly. Mose
looked steadily in her face, and then as he, too,
glanced upward, the same feeling of hopefulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and child-like confidence in the fatherly care of
God came over him.</p>

<p>“Yes, God will help us,” he responded, “and
we will trust in Him.”</p>

<p>That was enough&mdash;their hearts were at rest.
Had they been older, the doubts and skepticism
which often come with riper years, might have intervened
to dim the brightness of their cheerful
faith; but as it was, their child-like hearts leaned
with unwavering confidence upon this great staff
of hope, in the full assurance that it would not
fail them.</p>

<p>“Good night,” whispered Hesper, as she held
up her cheek for a parting kiss.</p>

<p>“Good night,” replied Mose, as he gave it, and
the next moment she was gone.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE GREYSONS AND GRIMSBYS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Greysons lived in a long, low, double house,
situated near the seashore, with nothing around it
to render it attractive or agreeable. The other
part was occupied by a family named Grimsby.
The father was in California, and the mother went
out washing. She was exceedingly sensitive on
this point, however, and was so much afraid the
neighbors would think less of her on account of it,
that she never missed an opportunity of telling
them they were no better than herself&mdash;that
every cent she had, she earned honestly, and that
was what everybody couldn’t say. Some were
foolish enough to reply, but they usually suffered
for it, as Mrs. Grimsby’s tongue was the terror of
the whole neighborhood. She was quite sure, she
said, that the time would come when she should be
able to look down on those who despised her now,
and make them feel it an honor to have their children
associate with hers.</p>

<p>Juliana, the oldest of the family, was a great,
slovenly girl&mdash;idle and disagreeable. Her long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
black hair, of which she had a great profusion,
was always in a heap, her dress torn and dirty,
her stockings out at the heels, and to finish her
appearance, she wore a pair of her mother’s shoes
which were much too large for her. It was very
easy to tell at what time Juliana arose in the
morning, for the great shoes could be heard clattering
down the stairs and shuffling through the
entry. Then too, the quarrelling was louder, the
baby cried oftener, and Mrs. Grimsby scolded at
the top of her voice.</p>

<p>There were also two boys in this family, George
Washington and Benjamin Franklin, who were a
little older than Fred and Charlie Greyson. Their
mother said they would prove themselves worthy
of their name, for two such boys couldn’t be
found anywhere, and in this last particular the
neighbors perfectly agreed with her. As there
was no public school within several miles, Hesper’s
two brothers were obliged to remain at home,
and as might have been expected of two little fellows,
six and eight years of age, having nothing
particular to do, they were very restless and uneasy.
Their father had no time to attend to them,
their mother was sick, and Hesper was always so
busy that it was quite impossible for her either to
amuse or instruct them. Accordingly they spent
the greater part of their time in the back-yard
where they kept a pair of beautiful white rabbits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which they had named Billy and Bunny. There
was also a pigstye on their side of the yard, and
in it a pig, so small and black that the children
called him Coaly, and made quite a pet of him.
Coaly was a knowing pig, and even Mose and
Hesper liked occasionally to make him a visit.</p>

<p>The opposite side of the yard belonged to the
Grimsbys. George kept ducks and Benny had a
goat. There was but little grass for the poor
creature to subsist upon, for the yard was small,
and at all seasons there was always a large pile of
wood or chips lying there, besides which, the boys
had scooped out a broad, deep hole, to make a
duck pond. Mrs. Grimsby threw all her slops and
broken victuals into the yard, and when she
washed at home she hung her clothes there. This
was always sure to end in a great quarrel with the
boys, who complained that she never minded
where she went, but upset everything and spoiled
all they did, just as though nobody had a right
there but herself.</p>

<p>Directly across the middle of the yard, forming
a line of division between the two families, was
planted a double row of sun-flowers, which had
grown up very tall and close. This had been
done by the young Grimsbys who were extremely
jealous of the Greysons, and had often accused
them of stealing. Even their mother had thrown
out broad hints at times, to Hesper, about missing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
her wood and chips, which almost broke the poor
girl’s heart, and roused her father’s indignation to
the highest pitch. It so happened at one time,
that she came in to make a complaint when Mr.
Greyson was at home. She had scarcely commenced
however, when to the great terror of the
children, their father rose up, and with a look and
tone that could not be mistaken, he commanded
her to take herself out of his premises directly, or
he would assist her in a way that might not be
very pleasing. Mrs. Grimsby did not wait to finish
her sentence, but beat a hasty retreat, and
never ventured in again unless fully assured of
the enemy’s absence.</p>

<p>The yard, however, was the great scene of action.
Notwithstanding all Hesper’s persuasions
and entreaties, Fred and Charlie would resent
every injury, and sometimes provoke assaults. In
fact the Greysons and Grimsbys were continually
at war. Fred was a high-spirited boy, and it was
entirely useless for Hesper to reason with him.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t talk so about it, if it was yourself,”
he would answer. “If they let out our rabbits,
we will untie their goat, and if they worry
Coaly we will let off their duck pond.”</p>

<p>Through that palisade of sun-flower stalks many
a word of defiance was spoken which received an
oyster shell for a reply, and many a challenge was
given which ended in a desperate conflict. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Grimsbys being the oldest, were usually triumphant,
and the Greysons would come off with
scratched faces and bloody noses. When Hesper
wept and their sick mother rose from her pillow to
entreat and reason with them, as she only knew
how to do, they would promise that they would
try to do better; but at the next outbreak Fred’s
excuse would be, “mother, I did try, but I couldn’t
help it.”</p>

<p>This was the greatest trial of Hesper’s life.
She would send them into the yard to get them
out of the way, and would often have to bring
them back again, to keep them out of trouble.
At last she appealed to her father.</p>

<p>“Let them fight their own battles,” he said. “If
our boys get beaten it will teach them a good lesson,
but if they beat the Grimsbys, they will
keep on their own premises.”</p>

<p>What could she do? her heart ached and her
tears flowed freely, but she said no more. Poor
children! they little thought how cruel it was to
grieve so good a sister.</p>

<p>There was one other member of the Grimsby
family, towards whom Hesper’s whole heart went
out in one great flood of affection. This was little
Tommy&mdash;an infant not a year old. There
was something in his little innocent face and soft
dark eyes, which appealed to her warmest sympathies.
He was a neglected child, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was often troublesome. His mother, with her
daily employment, could not attend to him, and
Juliana would not. Before his mother came home
from work, he would get tired and hungry, and
would scream with all his might. Juliana, by
scolding, and shaking, and by various other unreasonable
methods, endeavored to still him, but
finding it useless, she would tumble him into his
cradle or lay him down in the entry and run
away up stairs. She well knew that if she did
this Hesper would take care of him, for she never
could bear to hear him cry. Little Johnny, too,
was very fond of him, and they would play together
for hours. It was very interesting to see how
the poor simple child and the feeble infant loved
one another.</p>

<p>“They are very much alike,” Mrs. Greyson would
say, as she watched them. “One is an infant in
mind, and the other in body. God help my poor
boy! He will never know what it is to grow in
knowledge and wisdom, till he is born unto a better
life.” There was one person, however, who
did not agree with her in this, and that one was
Mr. Byers. He lived in an old tenant house, not
far from the Greysons, where he occupied two
rooms by himself, and did his own house work.
He supported himself by doing light work, in the
way of gardening and other odd jobs, as people
chose to employ him, and at night he wrote little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
facetious articles or short sermons for the daily papers,
which were usually very acceptable. He had
taken a great fancy to simple Johnny, for he said
there was more in that child than people imagined,
and if the poor innocent could only put his silent
thoughts into words, he would say some things
that would astonish the world. Often when he
was at work in the fields, simple Johnny would
come to visit him, holding a corn-basket over his
head as a protection from the sun, for the singular
child had taken a great dislike to wearing a hat.
Mr. Byers would help him through the fence with
his basket, and provide him a seat on some old log
or a large stone. Then he would go about his
work again, while the child watched his progress
with silent interest. Now and then the good old
man would stop to gather a few berries or wild
flowers for his little friend, or sing him a merry
old song, with which the child seemed to be
particularly delighted.</p>

<p>Mr. Byers was very fond of children generally,
and nothing delighted him more than, after his
day’s work was over, to wander along the seashore
with a whole troop of little ones around him, joining
in their sports, or telling them stories of such
a marvellous and amusing character, that the children
always listened with the deepest interest. At
such times he usually carried Mrs. Grimsby’s baby
in his arms, for he took a particular fancy to infants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and truly speaking, if nature had gifted Mr.
Byers with another pair of arms, he would certainly
have borrowed another baby, for he held to
the maxim, that “the more of a good thing the
better.” Simple Johnny clung to the skirt of his
coat, and the rest of the company followed promiscuously,
as they pleased.</p>

<p>In his presence alone could the young Greysons
and Grimsbys remain for any length of time, upon
amicable terms, and if any disagreement did occur,
which could not be settled by moral suasion, he
had such a summary manner of seizing the offender
by the convenient parts of his garments, and threatening
him with a dip in the water, that they were
very careful not to provoke his indignation.
George Grimsby, however, being usually the largest
boy of the party, had the audacity to question in
his mind whether this threat would ever be put
into execution. Accordingly, one night, he waxed
so bold that in his play he threw Fred Greyson’s
cap into the water and tumbled Johnny into a
mud-hole. Quick as thought Mr. Byers laid the
baby upon a heap of sea weed, and seizing George
by the collar, sprang upon a big rock near by, with
wonderful agility. In he plunged him at once,
and, to use familiar terms, he soused him up and
down and swaddled him about like a big dish cloth.
Then, standing him upon his feet, and giving him
a smart shaking to start the circulation again, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ordered him off home in such a decided manner
that George obeyed without a moment’s hesitation.
Mr. Byers was greatly exhausted with this performance,
nevertheless he reflected upon it with
great satisfaction. Out of this, however, grew a
long continued feud between the worthy gentleman
and Mrs. Grimsby, to which time alone was
able to afford the least modification.</p>

<p class="pch">AUNT BETSEY.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Aunt Betsey</span> was sister to Hesper’s father. Her
husband was comfortably situated, and they had
no children. They lived in a large, old-fashioned
house, where everything was convenient, and there
was no one to trouble them. She was one of the
most precise, prudent, pains-taking women in the
world, and was also very peculiar. Every part of
her house was as neat as possible, and she never
allowed any one, not even her husband, to change
the place of a single thing. On the floor of her
sitting room was a handsome, home-made carpet,
of aunt Betsey’s own manufacture. The hearth
rug, also, was her handiwork, and from its originality,
is worthy of particular description. The
pattern was a great yellow flower-pot, containing
a huge bouquet on a dark ground. In the centre
of the flowers was a monstrous white rose, and
around it a profusion of leaves, buds and blossoms,
among which might also be seen a bird,
a butterfly, and a bunch of cherries. She was very
proud of this, first, because she had planned and
made it all herself; and second, because it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
won a prize at an Industrial Exhibition, several
years previous.</p>

<p>In this room, directly across the wall overhead,
was a great wooden beam, such as is often seen in
old-fashioned houses. In this beam was inserted
a stout iron hook, and upon this hook hung a large
cage, containing several canaries. The reason
why this cage was placed so high, was because
aunt Betsey was also very fond of cats, and kept
quite a number. She allowed them to sleep on
her rug, to chase each other about the room and
frolic over the tables and chairs just as they pleased;
but when some of them came bounce into her work
basket and upset everything, she would scold in
good earnest. Besides her birds and cats she also
kept a great many flowers, and her plants were
the admiration of the whole village. On account
of the leaves and dirt she kept them all in her
kitchen. The windows were towards the south,
and in the winter she kept a fire burning all night,
lest they should freeze. Her flower-stand was constructed
in the form of a pyramid, each shelf being
filled with rare plants, while upon the very top
was a splendid cactus in full bloom. People said
that aunt Betsey had nothing to do but to make
herself comfortable and happy, but she thought
quite differently. What with her birds, cats,
flowers and housework, she was always busy. All
the time she could spare from these she devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fancy needle-work, which consisted of bead-bags
and purses, needle-books and pin-cushions, lamp-mats
and embroidery. She was also engaged upon
a satin bed-quilt, which had occupied her at intervals
for several years. It was made from bits of
satin, cut into a diamond shape, not more than an
inch across; these were basted upon paper, and
then the edge of a sufficient number sewed together
in the form of a star. There were stars of all
colors, filled in between with others of black satin.
Even to aunt Betsey this seemed an almost endless
undertaking, but she was determined to persevere,
for she was quite sure that when it was completed
it would win the first prize at the Exhibition.</p>

<p>One morning, as she sat by her open window,
busily engaged in matching her stars together, she
chanced to see aunt Nyna coming up the street,
leading simple Johnny, who, as usual, carried
Fido under his arm, while Bose followed behind.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” she said, as they came near,
“What’s the news?”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” replied aunt Nyna, “I have
just been down to see thy brother, and find him
much worse.”</p>

<p>“Worse! why, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Why, two or three days since, he hurt his foot
very badly, and I suppose he went out again too
soon, for he has worried it into such a state that
now he is quite sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Mercy me! Do tell!” said aunt Betsey.
“Well they are always in trouble. Almost every
day I drop in there, just by way of encouragement
and to tell them how things ought to go, but
of late I have been so busy with my bed-quilt I
haven’t had time for anything else. Well, I suppose
that now I must go or they will think hard
of me.”</p>

<p>“So I would for poor Hesper’s sake,” said aunt
Nyna. “She has just as much as she can attend to,
and it is hard work where there is so much to do
and nothing to do with. I am taking Johnny
home with me to keep him awhile, and if thou
wouldst just take the other two boys a few days,
it would be a great help to Hesper.”</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” exclaimed aunt Betsey, raising
her hands in astonishment, “I should as soon
think of taking two wild Indians into my house&mdash;besides
I should never get my bed-quilt done in
the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, and what if thee shouldn’t? It would
be of little consequence compared to helping the
poor girl.”</p>

<p>“Really!” replied aunt Betsey, very tartly, “I
should like to know!” She commenced sewing
again very diligently, without looking up or speaking
another word, so aunt Nyna turned away.</p>

<p>“There, I am glad she’s gone!” said aunt
Betsey. “Somehow or other I never could bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that woman, with her theeing and thouing.” She
tried to settle down to her work and feel as quiet
and comfortable as before, but her conscience
troubled her sorely.</p>

<p>“Well, if I must, I must,” she said at last,
starting up. “I’ll go and bring them home with
me, and bear it like a martyr.” She rolled up
her bits of satin, drove all her cats out of the
room, and then put on her bonnet and shawl.</p>

<p>“It won’t do,” she said, “to go into such a family
empty-handed, though where their wants are so
many, it seems almost entirely useless to give
them anything.”</p>

<p>She gathered together some broken victuals&mdash;tied
up a bundle of old cast-off garments, and
with this under her arm, she set out.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">A FAIR ATTEMPT.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">“O Fred!</span> Here comes aunt Betsey, with a
great budget,” said Charlie, who was looking out
of the window. “Let’s hide under the bed till
she is gone. She never stays long;” and without
another word under they went.</p>

<p>“What do you want to hide for?” asked Hesper.</p>

<p>“O, because we know she don’t like us,” and
Fred drew his head back quickly, for she was just
opening the door.</p>

<p>“Well-a-day, Hesper!” said aunt Betsey, with
a doleful countenance, “I hear you are in trouble
again, and I have come down to see what I can do
for you. How is your father, this morning? I
declare I never knew he had hurt him till just
now. Where is he?”</p>

<p>“In there,” said Hesper, pointing to the little
bed-room where Mose and Johnny usually slept.
“He has been restless all night, but he is asleep
now.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I won’t disturb him, for I am so
hurried with work that I can’t stop a minute. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
left everything in a heap and came down directly,
when I heard of your trouble. I declare I am all
out of breath with hurrying,” and she threw herself
into a chair by the bed.</p>

<p>“Well, Susan,” she said to Hesper’s mother,
“I should think you would get all tired out with
being sick so long, but I think Hesper looks
almost as frail as you, and I shouldn’t wonder at
all if she should give out.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid she will,” said her mother, and
she sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“O, no!” replied Hesper, cheerfully, “I haven’t
the least idea of it. I didn’t sleep much last
night, and am rather tired to-day, but I don’t feel
sick at all.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said aunt Betsey, “there’s no use in
undertaking too much, and I have really come
down with the intention of doing something to
help you.”</p>

<p>Here she hesitated, for she really dreaded to
make the proposition.</p>

<p>“You, Charlie;” whispered Fred&mdash;“if I
should catch at her foot how she would jump.”</p>

<p>The thought of aunt Betsey’s surprise quite
overcame Charlie, and in spite of his efforts he
could not restrain a laugh.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” exclaimed aunt Betsey. “What’s
that?” and she looked directly under the bed.
Her expressions of wonder, and the angry manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
in which she eyed them over her spectacles, was
perfectly irresistible, and laughing with all their
might, they crept out.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” said she, “you act as
though you weren’t half civilized, and I almost
repent of my resolution. As I was just saying to
Hesper, I came down to take you home with me,
to spend a few days. It will be a great relief to
your mother and sister, for I know you are bad
boys, and are dreadfully troublesome.”</p>

<p>The boys were sober in a moment. Fred looked
at Charlie and Charlie at Fred, but neither of
them spoke a word. Now that aunt Betsey had
given the invitation, she was quite determined
they should go.</p>

<p>“Well, what is the matter?” said she, “I don’t
want you to work for me. I only want you to behave
yourselves, if you can, and I will do all I
can to please you. You shall have some apples to
roast, and if your Uncle Nathan is willing, I will
give you one of his great pumpkins for a jack-o’lantern.”</p>

<p>It was evident that she had touched the right
chord, for the boys assented immediately. Hesper
was much pleased, and began to prepare them
as soon as possible. Soon all was ready, and they
set out, with the parting injunction from Hesper,
to be good boys.</p>

<p>It was so quiet and peaceful after they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gone, and Hesper’s mind was so much relieved,
that after making some gruel for her father’s dinner,
she sat down in the great rocking chair, and in
a few moments was fast asleep. Poor Hesper was
almost sick. Mose watched her from day to day,
and when he saw her cheek grow pale, his heart
failed him. He sat very often upon the old log by
the mill-dam, but it was not to think over his own
troubles. They were all forgotten in his care for
Hesper, and knowing not what else to do, he
prayed for her most earnestly.</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">POOR SUCCESS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Aunt Betsey</span> did not find the boys so much of a
hindrance as she had expected. They sat very quietly
by the fire, looking at the pictures in a book of
Natural History, while she continued sewing upon
her bed-quilt as before. She soon had occasion
though, to stir up the fire, and as she did so, she
spied a great muddy foot-mark directly across the
white rose in the centre of her rug. “O dear!”
she exclaimed, “did I ever see such dirty children?”
She was just beginning to scold, when
she checked herself, for she thought that she was
most to blame, for not telling them to clean their
feet well when they came in. Charlie said he
was very sorry, and Fred proposed that they
should go out and scrape their boots directly.
Meanwhile Aunt Betsey took the rug into the
kitchen, and after a little drying and brushing it
looked as well as ever.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “it isn’t so bad after all, and
if I don’t meet with anything worse, I’ll not complain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>When she went back she found that the boys
after they had cleaned their boots, had left them
in the entry, which pleased her very much. She
gave them some apples to roast, and then she concluded
to go down to her husband’s store of an
errand.</p>

<p>“Be very careful,” said she, as she went out,
“and behave yourselves properly till I come
back.”</p>

<p>When the boys had roasted their apples, they
set them aside to cool, and began to play with the
cats.</p>

<p>“Fred,” said Charlie, “shouldn’t you think
that Aunt Betsey would be afraid that her cats
would eat the birds?”</p>

<p>“O no,” said Fred, “for they hang so high they
cannot get at them.”</p>

<p>“But,” continued Charlie, whose curiosity was
always wide awake, “I wonder what the birds
would do if they should see this old grey cat
close to the cage?”</p>

<p>“Let’s try;” said Fred. “I’ll hold her tight,”
and the “next moment he was standing up in a
chair, under the cage, with the cat in his arms.</p>

<p>“I can’t reach,” said he. So he got down and
looked about for something higher. Now that he
had undertaken, he was quite determined to see
the result of the experiment. While Charlie
looked out for Aunt Betsey, Fred rolled the dining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
table into the middle of the floor, placed a chair
on top, and then climbed up again with the cat.
Of course the birds fluttered about in a great
fright, and as might have been expected, the cat
sprang at them. In his struggle to hold the cat,
Fred lost his footing. He grasped at the cage to
save himself, but the hook gave way, and down
they all came together. Charlie opened the door
and rushed out into the entry, followed by all of
the cats. At first he thought he would take his
cap and start for home immediately, and then he
concluded to go back and see what had become of
Fred. There he sat among the ruins looking very
much bewildered.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p>“No;” replied Fred, “but I expect I shall be,
when Aunt Betsey comes.”</p>

<p>He got up quickly, and with Charlie’s assistance,
they rolled the table into its place again.</p>

<p>“O dear! what shall we tell her?” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“Tell her the truth,” replied Fred, and then they
both stood still and looked at the cage. Some of
the birds were clinging to the wires, panting for
breath, and one poor little fellow had his head
thrust out, and his legs hanging down, perfectly
helpless. The cage was bent all out of shape, and
the glass cups for the seed and water were dashed
in pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish that little bird would take his head in,”
said Charlie. He put his finger gently against the
bill to push it back, and the bird dropped motionless
on the floor of the cage.</p>

<p>“He is dead!” said Charlie, and both boys
burst into tears. They could have borne Aunt
Betsey’s anger, they could have borne punishment,
or anything that might have come because
of this, without being deeply moved, but the sight
of that little dead bird was heart-rending.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that God sees it?” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Fred, “for it was only last night,
Hesper told me that not a sparrow fell to the
ground without His notice.” And as this thought
came home to them with full force, they were
wholly overcome, and burst into loud lamentations.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” said Aunt Betsey, as she opened
the door, “what is the matter?” and then she
stood still in astonishment. “How did this happen?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Fred tried to summon moral courage enough to
tell the whole truth, but his heart failed him.</p>

<p>“O dear!” he sobbed, “the cage fell down, and
one of the birds is dead.”</p>

<p>“How sorry I am;” said Aunt Betsey. And
she looked more grieved than angry. “I am sure
I thought the hook was strong enough.” She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
took the cage, and was about placing it on the table,
when she observed the seed and the water
scattered all over the cloth.</p>

<p>“Why! how is this?” she asked, and then she
minded Fred’s jacket was in the same plight.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how to understand it,” she
said&mdash;“did the cage fall upon you?”</p>

<p>“No,” stammered Fred, “I fell on to the cage.”</p>

<p>She shook her head and looked very serious.
“It is plain,” said she, “that there is something
wrong about this, and now I want you to tell me
the whole truth. I am sorry for the injury done
my carpet&mdash;I am sorry for the loss of my bird,
but don’t tell a lie Fred, for that would be worse
than all.”</p>

<p>Fred took his old calico handkerchief from his
pocket, and after he had wiped his eyes, he looked
up to Aunt Betsey with an honest face, and told
her the whole truth.</p>

<p>She did not speak, but she sat down and thought
a long time. It seemed to her that she must send
them home directly&mdash;that she could not have
them in the house another minute. Then she
thought of poor Hesper&mdash;of her sick father and
mother, and the disappointment it would be to all.</p>

<p>“I will try to be patient a little longer,” she
said. She took up the cage and began to sweep
the pieces of glass together.</p>

<p>“Don’t you mean to do anything to me?”
asked Fred. “I think I deserve it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“No;” said aunt Betsey, looking very sober.
She opened the cage, and taking out the dead
bird, laid it in his hand&mdash;-</p>

<p>“There,” said she, “if that don’t make you feel
sorry, I don’t know what will.” Both of the boys
burst into tears again, and cried so loud that aunt
Betsey was right glad to pacify them. She put
the dead bird out of sight, and told them they had
best sit down by the fire, while she spread the
table. They did as she desired, but they did not
speak or stir from their chairs, and she knew by
their deep sobs that their sorrow was unaffected.
After dinner she asked them to wind some silk for
her. They were glad to do anything she wished,
and while Charlie held the skein, Fred wound it
very carefully. When they had finished this, they
asked her to let them do something else. She
said she had a great basket of unshelled beans in
the kitchen, and if they wished they might go out
and shell them. She went with them, and after
giving them some low seats, and a great basin to
put the beans in, she went back to her work. For
a long time she heard them chatting together and
the beans dropping into the pan very fast. “I
am glad,” she thought, “that I did not send them
home. They seem to be very good hearted boys,
only a little mischievous.” Then her thoughts
became so much occupied with matching her
pieces, that she forgot all about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly there came a terrible crash, and then
a scream. She rushed into the kitchen as quickly
as possible. There was her flower-stand completely
overturned&mdash;the plants, pots and earth,
scattered all about the floor, and Charlie lying in
the midst. His nose was bleeding, and as he got
up he was a most pitiful looking object. Fred
stood by, pale with terror.</p>

<p>“He only went up the steps “&mdash;stammered Fred
by way of explanation&mdash;“to smell of the flower
on top, and it all broke down together.”</p>

<p>Aunt Betsey gave way to her feelings in tears,
for this was indeed a little more than she could
bear.</p>

<p>“There, now,” said she, “that is enough. Get
your caps and boots this minute, for I mean to take
you straight home. I don’t know what will be
done with you for this, but you can’t expect much
mercy.”</p>

<p>The boys obeyed in silence. They dreaded to
go home, but they dared not say a word against it.
As they went along, accompanied by aunt Betsey,
Fred looked up to the hills and woods beyond,
longing for a chance to slip away and hide; for,
as aunt Betsey said, he didn’t know what would
be done with them, but she held their hands
tightly and walked very fast, for she was much
excited.</p>

<p>“There!” she exclaimed, as she threw open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
door and made her appearance before Hesper, “I
have brought them back. I would have kept them
longer, but”&mdash;and she burst into tears&mdash;“they
pulled down my cage and killed my bird, and
broke my flower-stand all in pieces. I will sew for
you&mdash;I will wash or bake, or do anything else to
help you, but as to keeping these boys I can’t. If
I were in your place I would send them to the
House of Correction directly.” She waited for
Hesper to reply, but she did not. The poor girl
sat with her hands folded and her eyes fixed upon
the floor. Her silent look of sorrow was more
touching than words. Aunt Betsey could not
bear it.</p>

<p>“I will come again,” said she, “when I feel
better,” and she went away. Tick, tick, tick,
went the old clock in the corner, and that was the
only sound to be heard. Fred wished that she
would scold, or beat him, or do anything but sit
and look so sorrowful. Simple Johnny, who had
come in to get his basket of playthings to take to
aunt Nyna’s, knew that something unusual had
happened. He looked from one to the other, and
when he saw the tears rolling down Hesper’s
cheeks, he stole softly up to her. He put his arm
around her neck and laid his head on her bosom.</p>

<p>“Dear Johnny,” said Hesper, as she clasped
him closely to her&mdash;“though you are a poor,
simple child, yet you never make your sister’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
heart ache.” That was enough. The silence was
broken, and moved as by one impulse, both boys
rushed towards her and hid their faces in her lap.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Hesper,” sobbed Fred, “don’t cry!
and we will do all we can to help you. We do
want to be good boys, but we don’t know how.”
Hesper took their hands in her own, and looked
steadily in their faces. She was very earnest, and
her voice trembled, but she talked to them as only
a loving and gentle hearted sister could. She told
them, in simple words, of their father’s and mother’s
sickness&mdash;of the weariness and hard labor of
Mose, of the helplessness of little Johnny, of her
own heavy trials, and then she told them very
kindly, but so plainly they could not misunderstand,
that now they were old enough to think of
these things, and if they could not be of any
assistance, they might, at least, try not to add to
the trouble. Her words were fitly spoken, and
they went down to the deep places of the children’s
hearts. She had appealed to reason and affection,
when they expected nothing but punishment and
reproof.</p>

<p>“I wish we could do something,” said Charlie.
His little childish face was the picture of anxious
care, and his eyes were swollen with weeping.
Poor children! for them it had been a day of
hard, but salutary experience.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you!” exclaimed Fred, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
quick for a thought&mdash;“let’s take the great basket
and go down where Capt. Clark’s ship is building,
and ask him to give us some chips.” Both boys
made a rush for the basket at once.</p>

<p>“Hush! hush!” whispered Hesper. That was
enough; they checked themselves in an instant,
and stole softly out of the house. That night, if
aunt Betsey could have looked into the old shed,
and seen the great pile of chips there, she would
have been astonished. The ship-yard was a far
better place than the House of Correction.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">HESPER’S NEW FROCK.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">“Hesper,”</span> said Mose, one morning, just as he
was going to his work&mdash;“how much does it take
to make you a frock?”</p>

<p>“O, never mind,” she replied, “I don’t want a
new one. But there is one thing I do want, Mose,
and that is that you should get you a good warm
coat for winter. You will feel the need of it bitterly,
when you come out of the hot mill into the
cold, north wind, or perhaps a driving snow-storm.”</p>

<p>“I can’t have a coat till you have a new frock,”
said Mose decidedly.</p>

<p>“Well then,” said she, “I shall try to get one
as soon as possible. Perhaps the fairies are weaving
one now, and will bring it along the next time
the moon fulls. We will wait and see.”</p>

<p>It happened very strangely, that not long after
this conversation, aunt Betsey came in. She was
very sorry that she had not been able to help Hesper
by keeping the boys, and now she was determined
to make amends in some other way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hesper,” said she, “I have been thinking I
would make you a new frock. I looked about the
house and found an old black, bombazine dress,
which will do very well to alter for you. I have
come down now to take your measure, but I must
be very quick, for I am still in a great hurry with
my bed-quilt, and I wish to get the dress done to-night.”</p>

<p>Hesper thought she should not like a black bombazine
dress, but she would not say so, lest she
should wound aunt Betsey’s feelings. So she let
her take the measure as she desired.</p>

<p>Before night aunt Betsey made her appearance
again, with the dress all finished. She helped
Hesper put it on, and then viewed it with great
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“There,” said she, “it fits nicely. I’m glad
I’ve done you some good at last, though I don’t
want to boast of it. You needn’t try to be saving
of it, but wear it just as much as you please,”&mdash;and
then she went away, before Hesper had a
chance to say how she liked it. The skirt of the
dress was very scanty, and so long that it came almost
to her feet. The waist was short, and the
sleeves large, and it was made so high in the neck
that she could scarce bend her head. It felt very
uncomfortable, but Hesper tried not to think of it,
though she found it very hard to do so, for when
she sat down to her work, she had to turn her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
head this side and that, to keep it from choking
her, and almost the first thing she did, was to step
on the skirt and fall. It was a real vexation, but
she thought that aunt Betsey had taken a great
deal of pains, and therefore she ought to be very
grateful.</p>

<p>“Bless me! Hesper,” said her father, as soon
as he saw her&mdash;“is that you? Why you look
like some of the strange, black shadows I see in
my dreams.”</p>

<p>“O! dear child!” said her mother, when she
awoke, “you are all dressed in mourning. It
makes me feel gloomy.”</p>

<p>Mose expressed his disapprobation in very strong
terms, and as for Fred and Charlie, they laughed
with all their might at Hesper’s strange appearance.
Even simple Johnny pushed away the
dress when it touched him, with a look of great
dislike. She felt awkward and uneasy, and longed
to slip on her old frock again, but she thought of
aunt Betsey’s kindness, and determined to persevere.</p>

<p>After Fred and Charlie had gone to bed that
night, they began, in low whispers, to talk over
matters and things. By making a few inquiries,
they had found out the whole history of Hesper’s
new frock, and now they were considering the possibility
of getting her another.</p>

<p>“How much money do you suppose we could
get for our rabbits?” asked Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“O, not much,” replied Fred. “They aren’t
good for anything but to eat.”</p>

<p>“To eat!” exclaimed Charlie, “I would not
sell Billy and Bunny for people to eat, not for all
the money in the world.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to,” said Fred, “but that’s
the only thing we can do.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Charlie, as he drew a long
breath, “then we will, though I wish we could
think of something else.”</p>

<p>The next morning they went out bright and
early to get their rabbits, resolved to make the
sacrifice, but one was missing. They searched all
about the yard, and peeped into every crack and
corner, but it was nowhere to be found. Charlie
cried, and Fred scolded.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, “the Grimsby boys have stolen
him, and I’ll call them thieves every time I see
them. If it wasn’t for Hesper, I would tumble
them both into the duck pond. I’ll call them
thieves though, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Hesper, who stood close behind
them. She had heard the crying and came out to
see what it meant. “If you begin with hard
names, you will soon come to blows. Leave it to
me, and see if I can’t get your rabbit again, without
any trouble. Perhaps the Grimsby boys know
nothing about it, and then you would have no
reason whatever for calling them thieves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Fred was just beginning to argue the case,
when Hesper said, “Now don’t,” in such a pleasant,
persuasive way, that he gave it up and went
off, but it was a great disappointment.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">A GREAT SECRET.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">There</span> was no person in the whole village kinder,
or more considerate to those in trouble, than Capt.
Clark. He owned several large ships and part of
the mill where Mose worked. He was formerly a
sea-captain, but now he lived at home with his
aged mother, for he had no family of his own.
When he heard how much trouble Hesper had
with her two brothers, he offered to employ them
on his farm during the harvest.</p>

<p>One Saturday night, just as the full moon was
rising above the hills, Fred and Charlie finished
their day’s work, and were about to return home.
Capt. Clark called the boys into the great store
room, and told them to fill their handkerchiefs
with apples and corn.</p>

<p>“Now boys,” said he, “you have worked well,
and I am very much pleased. Here is a new
silver dollar for each of you, and when you go
home, tell Hesper that I say you have behaved
like men.” It seemed to the boys as though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
could feel themselves grow taller that very minute.
Their hearts really did expand, as they thought
that they had been doing something useful, for
which they were justly praised and rewarded. “I
never felt so happy in all my life,” said Fred, as
they trudged along towards home, with their stout
oaken sticks over their shoulders, to which they
had attached their bundles.</p>

<p>“Nor I, either,” replied Charlie. “Only think,
Fred? Two great silver dollars! What shall we
do with them? We can buy a whole lot of ducks,
and have a pond of our own.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Fred, “and some more rabbits.”</p>

<p>“No!” exclaimed both boys at once, “Hesper’s
frock! O, now we can do it!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how we shall manage about
buying it though,” said Fred, “for I am sure I
don’t know how, and if we tell Hesper, she won’t
let us do anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we ask aunt Nyna?” suggested Charlie.</p>

<p>“Just the very one!” replied Fred, “and here
we are, close by. Let’s go in now”&mdash;and both
boys started upon a run, up the lane that led to
the cottage.</p>

<p>The good lady was very much surprised as she
sat at her tea table, to see these two little fellows
come marching in with their sticks and bundles.</p>

<p>“Whither now, my young travellers?” she
said. “Have ye come to bid me good bye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Fred, “we’ve come on business.”</p>

<p>“On business!” she repeated, with a comical
look&mdash;“well what is it?” Fred laid the silver
dollars on the table.</p>

<p>“There,” said he, “Capt. Clark paid us those
for our work. Now we want you to take them
and buy Hesper a new dress&mdash;a real good one,
and have it made in the very prettiest way.”</p>

<p>“Heaven bless ye, darlings!” exclaimed the
old lady. “How delighted Hesper will be! Yea,
I will go down to the village as soon as possible,
to purchase it, and if one of you will manage to
bring me her old frock to-night, I will have the
dress all finished on Monday.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Fred, “we will run home directly,
and as soon as we get a good chance, one of us
will bring you the frock. Good night”&mdash;and
away they started. When they came in sight of
home, they observed George Grimsby standing at
the front door, crying and making a great noise.
As soon as Fred saw him he thought of the rabbit,
and made up his mind to call him a thief. But
he remembered what Hesper had said, and changed
his purpose; besides, just then he felt too good
natured.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, George?” he said, very
kindly.</p>

<p>“None o’yer business!” returned George.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“I’ve a right ter cry when I’m a mind ter, without
everybody’s askin’ me what’s ther matter.”</p>

<p>“So you have,” said Fred, and he was just
about giving him a poke with his stick, when he
changed his mind again, and instead of doing so,
drew two large apples from his bundle, and held
them towards him. George stopped crying and
stared at him with open mouth and eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want them?” asked Fred. He put
out his hand slowly, still looking Fred in the face.
Then he snatched the apples, and turning about,
ran through the entry without speaking a word.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Fred, indignantly, “did you
ever see such actions! Now I am sorry I gave
them to him. I mean to tell Hesper of that.”
Mose and Hesper both laughed well when Fred
made his complaint.</p>

<p>“I can tell you what made him act so,” said
Hesper. “It was because he was ashamed of
having answered you thus, and if I am not much
mistaken, he will speak very pleasantly the next
time he sees you.” While they were talking the
matter over, the door was opened a little way, and
the lost rabbit hopped into the room. Then the
door was quickly closed again.</p>

<p>“There!” said Hesper, “see what your apples
have brought you already. How much better that
was, than calling him a thief!”</p>

<p>After tea, when there was a good opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Charlie stole up into Hesper’s chamber, and threw
her old frock out of the window. As had been
previously agreed upon, Fred was below to receive
it. Away he went with it to aunt Nyna’s, and
was back again before Hesper missed him. It was
almost impossible, however, for the boys to keep
from letting out the secret. They were constantly
whispering together&mdash;sly hints were dropped, and
finally they were obliged to tell their mother, lest
it should prove too much for them. When Hesper
missed her old frock and searched the whole house
for it, Fred and Charlie had to run out into the
yard to keep themselves quiet. Their mother told
Hesper not to worry about it, for she had no doubt
the frock would come back again. The poor girl
couldn’t think what it all meant. Monday morning,
the boys stepped into aunt Nyna’s to see how
she got along, and they went in again at night, to
tell her they had gone home, and now she could
come.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you eat your supper?” said Hesper,
as they sat whispering over their bread and
milk.</p>

<p>“O, we are only talking over a little business,”
replied Fred.</p>

<p>Their father was not yet able to work in the
mill, but he had been engaged by Capt. Clark to
keep his accounts. Now he sat by the fire writing,
looking very pale and sober. Mose was there too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
studying over his old geography, and their mother,
who could sit up a little now and then, occupied
the great rocking-chair in the corner. She
well understood the feelings of the boys, and
smiled often as they gave her expressive glances.</p>

<p>At last the door opened&mdash;both boys sprang to
their feet&mdash;aunt Nyna made her appearance and
unrolled the frock.</p>

<p>“Here, Hesper,” said she, “is a nice, warm
dress, which two good people sent you. I can’t
tell their names, but I hope you will find them
out.”</p>

<p>Hesper seemed very much surprised, and the
boys dropped under the table. Their father looked
up from his writing, and Mose laid down his
book.</p>

<p>“There,” he exclaimed, “didn’t you say, Hesper,
that when the moon fulled again, the fairies
would send you a dress?”</p>

<p>“But, who are the fairies?” said Hesper.</p>

<p>Aunt Nyna pointed under the table. The boys
could restrain themselves no longer. They rolled
on the floor and laughed till they were tired.
When they became quiet, in some measure, aunt
Nyna told the whole story, though they kept crying
out all the time for her to stop. Hesper’s
heart was too full to speak. She slipped away to
her chamber, and when she had put on the dress,
she went down again. It fitted so nicely and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
looked so pretty, they could scarce praise it
enough. Fred and Charlie were perfectly satisfied
with the way they had spent their money.</p>

<p>“Come here, my boys,” said their father, “I
want to say to you plainly, that I am proud of
you, and whatever befalls me in life, I will always
thank God that he has given me such good children.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">JULIANA.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> story of the two silver dollars was soon
known all about the village. Capt. Clark heard
of it, and so did aunt Betsey, but she was careful
not to say anything. She was so anxious, however,
to see the new frock, that she made an excuse
to call. She took one of her own flower-pots, containing
a beautiful rose-bush in full bloom, and
carrying it down, made Hesper a present of it.</p>

<p>Of course Hesper was delighted, for she was
very fond of flowers, and when aunt Betsey saw
how much real pleasure it gave her, she felt very
kindly towards her, and said many things in praise
of her good management.</p>

<p>Directly after aunt Betsey had left, the door
was slowly opened, and Juliana Grimsby stole
into the room. The poor girl acted very awkwardly,
and Hesper thought she had never seen
her look so ragged and dirty before. Her hair
was all in a heap, and, as if conscious of her unattractive
appearance, she did not raise her eyes
from the floor when she spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“I want something of you, Hesper,” she said,
“but I am almost afraid to ask you.”</p>

<p>“O fie,” said Hesper, laughing, “don’t be afraid.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, mother said if I would ask you for a bit
of your dress, she would try to get me one like it.
But I told her you wouldn’t want me to have one
from the same piece.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said Hesper. “It would be just
the thing; for then we could see which would
keep them whole and clean the longest.”</p>

<p>“Nothing ever keeps whole or clean to our
house,” said Juliana, with a doleful look. “I’ve
got tired living so, for my part. You can’t think
how much ashamed I feel when I peep into your
room and see it looking so neat and orderly, while
our house is nothing but dirt from one end to the
other.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you get a chance to clear up a little,
while Tommy is asleep,” asked Hesper.</p>

<p>“Clear up!” repeated Juliana, “just look
here!” and she threw open the door of the room,
“Did you ever see such a sight?”</p>

<p>The breakfast table was standing in the middle
of the floor, covered with dishes and broken victuals.
The beds were unmade, and dirt, and grease,
and cobwebs, met the eye wherever one looked.
Old shoes, and chips, and oyster shells, were
strewn about the floor, and the chairs were loaded
with garments of every description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“There,” said Juliana, “isn’t that enough to
discourage anybody? Mother calls me a real do-nothing,
and so do all the neighbors, but I won’t
try to be any better, for it’s no use. If I could
only run away from this house and live among
decent people, I should be as neat as anybody, but
now all I can do is, to take care of the baby, and
quarrel with the boys.”</p>

<p>The poor girl actually shed tears at her miserable
condition.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as you will like it,” she continued,
“but I feel, now I have begun, that I want
to tell you all. I have seen the time, Hesper
Greyson, when I actually hated you, because I
knew you were better than myself; and at the
same time I tried to be like you. But I couldn’t,
for mother and all of ‘em were against me, so I
gave it up and was ten times worse than ever.
What would you do if you were in my place?”</p>

<p>“I would never give up,” said Hesper, “so long
as I was able to pick up a chip, or handle a broom.
I would begin now.” Juliana looked round despairingly,
and shook her head.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” said she. “I might as well
undertake to clear up the duck-pond.”</p>

<p>“Try,” said Hesper. “Try, and I will help
you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve almost a mind to,” replied Juliana, as
she caught a little of the hopeful, persevering
spirit of her friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Hesper, “you put on some water
to heat, while I run up and change my dress”. It
was not many minutes before she was back again.
While the water was heating, Juliana cleared
away the table and made the beds, and Hesper
swept the floor. She brushed the cobwebs from the
windows and walls, and cleared out every nook
and corner where the dust had not been started
for months. Then Juliana began to wash the
dishes, while Hesper took some water and cleaned
the windows. It made a wonderful difference in
the appearance of the room&mdash;a whole flood of sunshine
seemed to come in at once. When this was
done, they got a great tub of water, and both
together began to scour the floor. It was really
astonishing when one part was finished, to see how
it contrasted with the other.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have believed it,” said Juliana.
“It certainly looks enough better to pay us for the
trouble!” Before they had finished, they heard a
great noise in the entry.</p>

<p>“There are the boys!” exclaimed Juliana.
“Isn’t it too bad! but they shan’t come in.” She
sprang up, and pushing the door together quickly,
turned the key. The boys commenced kicking
and pounding with all their might, while Juliana
scolded. This waked up Tommy and he began to
cry.</p>

<p>“O dear!” whimpered Juliana, “I knew it
would be so. I wish I hadn’t begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be discouraged,” said Hesper, “but let
the boys in.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” sobbed Juliana, “they will spoil
everything if I do. I know ‘em too well.”</p>

<p>“Let me,” said Hesper. She opened the door
very gently, and the two boys were about to rush
in, but when they saw Hesper, they stopped.</p>

<p>“Be very careful,” she said, “for we are washing
up the floor, and want it to look nice. Little
Tommy has just waked up, and if you will take
care of him, it will help us very much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want ter take care o’ Tommy,” said
George, with a dogged look&mdash;“and what’s more,
I wont.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Hesper, “perhaps you and
Benny would like to take the pail and get us some
more water.”</p>

<p>“No; we wont do that nuther,” replied George,
“for I don’t want to have it clean.” He twisted
the buttons of his jacket as he spoke, and pouted
out his lips in a very unbecoming manner. Hesper
was puzzled. She stopped to think one
moment; then she laid her hand on his shoulder,
and stooping down so that she could look into his
eyes, she said with a pleasant smile&mdash;</p>

<p>“Please, George, wont you get us some water?
We want to have it all clean here to-night when
your mother comes home, and make her wonder
how it was done. Then, too, I will give you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Benny some corn to parch this evening, and you
can have a nice time.” George glanced up to
Hesper’s face and half smiled; she put the pail
into his hand and away they went. When they
came back, they sat the pail down by the door, and
stood without.</p>

<p>“Can’t we carry Tommy out to see the ducks?”
asked George.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you please,” said Hesper. She put on
the baby’s hood, and after wrapping him up in his
cradle quilt, laid him into George’s arms, who carried
him very carefully into the yard.</p>

<p>“There!” said Juliana, “I call that a complete
victory! and I see how it was gained, but I
am sure I never should have the patience to do so
myself.”</p>

<p>“O, you would soon learn,” said Hesper, “and
you would find that it saved a great deal of trouble
in the end.” After this, the girls went on working
and chatting together, till they became very
social and friendly. Juliana opened her whole
heart to Hesper; and Hesper, in return, wondered
they had never been so well acquainted before.
It was almost night before they finished, but then
the work was not only done, but done well. The
boys had been very obliging; they brought several
pails of water, and took care of Tommy all the
time. Moreover, they became gradually very
much interested in the work, and when all was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
finished, they confessed that it looked a great deal
better. Last of all, Juliana gave her own face
and hands a good washing, which they greatly
needed. Then Hesper combed out her long, beautiful
black hair, and after braiding it, she tied it
up behind with some bits of blue ribbon. When
the boys saw this, they were determined not to be
outdone. They carried a great basin of water and
some soap out into the yard, and scrubbed their
faces and hands with all their might. It was
quite a novelty to the Grimsby family to be so
clean, and they seemed to enjoy it highly.</p>

<p>“There!” said Hesper, after they had spread
the table for supper, “I think I will go now, as
there is nothing more to do,” and she looked
about the room with perfect satisfaction. There
was a clean cloth upon the table that night&mdash;the
knives and forks had been scoured, and the teapot,
which set upon the stove, shone like new
silver. The fire burned briskly, and little Tommy
was asleep in his cradle. As Hesper turned away,
she felt that a good work had been begun, and
was quite confident that it would not end here.
Not long after her return home, there came a low
tap at the door. She opened it, and there stood
Juliana.</p>

<p>“O Hesper!” said she, “you can’t think how
pleased mother is! She has gone now to get my
new dress. Father has sent us some money from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
California, and she says we shall all have better
clothes. I am dreadfully tired, but O, I am so
happy! and I can’t tell you how much I love you,”
She threw her arms around Hesper’s neck, and
laying her head upon her bosom, wept like a child.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">NEW PROSPECTS FOR MOSE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">One</span> delightful afternoon in the time usually
known as “Indian summer,” Hesper thought she
would take simple Johnny out for a walk. They
went up over the hills, and away down past Capt.
Clark’s corn-field, to the great barn beyond, where
Fred and Charlie were still at work. When they
saw Johnny with her, they begged her to let him
stay until they came home at night, so she left
him and went away into the woods beyond the
Rolling Mill. She walked along the borders of
the stream, gathering here and there the bright
colored autumn leaves, which seemed to be more
brilliant and beautiful than ever. As she climbed
up to the top of an old rock, which jutted out into
the pathway, to gather a few leaves of a bright
scarlet color, she heard the sound of voices, and
looking down upon the other side, saw Capt.
Clark and Mose talking together. They observed
her at the same moment, and called her to come
down. Capt. Clark rose up quickly, and put up
his strong arm to help her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, Hesper,” said he, “you are certainly a
good little fairy, for you are always near when
most wanted. I am laying a plan to get your
brother away from you, and I know when you
come to hear it, you will have too much good
sense to say no.”</p>

<p>She sat down by Mose and looked him in the
face. He seemed both glad and sorry. His old
geography was open in his hand.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said he, “you told me the Lord would
help me, and now your words are about to prove
true.”</p>

<p>“Why!” she exclaimed, “are you really going
to sea?”</p>

<p>He smiled and looked towards Capt. Clark.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Captain, “he thinks he shall,
if Hesper is willing.”</p>

<p>“If I am willing!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mose says that if every one else gives
their consent, and you are unhappy about it, he
will not go.”</p>

<p>“Why Mose!” said Hesper, “I thought you
knew me better.”</p>

<p>“You never think of yourself,” said Mose, “but
when I think of father’s poor health and mother’s
sickness, and the children to take care of through
this long winter, I feel as though I ought not to
go, for then all the burden and care will rest upon
you, and though you are a patient little thing you
are not able to bear it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Mose, if you have a good
chance, don’t lose it. Leave all the rest with the
Lord.”</p>

<p>Capt. Clark turned his face towards the stream
as she said this. If any one had been watching
him they would have seen him brush away a tear.
He was a very benevolent man, and he always
said, that there was something in the love which
this brother and sister bore one another, that
touched his heart.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said he, “you are right. Tell him
to go&mdash;it will be both for his health and interest,
and you can safely trust to the Lord for the rest.
I can also assure you, that as far as I am concerned,
you have one friend who will never see you
suffer. Now I will leave you to talk the subject
over together.” And he walked away down the
path, towards the mill.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mose, “now for my story. Capt.
Clark has talked with me very often of late. He
said he thought I was working too hard, and
asked me if there was anything else I would rather
do. I did not tell him for some time, because
I had tried to forget it myself and be patient; but
to-day he found me poring over my old geography,
and then he asked me how I would like to visit foreign
countries. Before I thought, I told him all,
and he said I should go to sea if I wished&mdash;that his
new ship would be ready in the course of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
weeks, and if I decided to go, he would ensure
me an easy place and good wages. O Hesper!
it made my heart leap right up within me;
but then I remembered I had not a cent to fit myself
out with, and therefore I could not answer
him.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Mose?” said he, “I
should think you would be right glad of such a
chance.”</p>

<p>“I was ashamed to let him know how poor we
were, but he questioned me so closely, and when he
found out the cause of my silence, he told me he
would let me have all I needed and right welcome.
Now, Hesper, what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Go!” said she, “go, Mose.” The tears stood
in her eyes and her voice trembled as she spoke.
“We shall miss you very much, and I, most of all,
Mose, for you and I know each other’s hearts and
our thoughts are very nearly the same, so it will
be hard parting, but if it wasn’t the best thing for
both of us, the Lord wouldn’t have so ordered
it.”</p>

<p>“It will be a long time that I shall be away,
Hesper, and I am afraid that when I mention it to
father, he will set his foot right down, and shake
his head, and there will be an end of it.”</p>

<p>“O dear,” said Hesper, “I had forgotten him.
It will be just as he takes a notion. How I wish
he could see things as we do. But he must always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
look on the dark side. How shall we
manage to tell him, Mose?”</p>

<p>They were silent for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said Mose at last, “the more I think
about it, the more certain am I that father will
not let me go. Every cent I have earned, has
gone to support the family, and now, while his foot
is still so lame, I don’t see how he can do without
me. We had best give it up where it is, and say
nothing more about it.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Hesper. “Don’t give it up, Mose.
Let’s try at any rate. I will send the children to
bed early, and then, while mother is asleep, you
can ask him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mose, “I don’t think it will be of
much use, but I wont have it said that I gave up
without trying. I must go back to the mill now.
Mr. Brown gave me leave of an hour’s absence,
while they were repairing the machinery, so I
came here to rest me.”</p>

<p>That night, when all was quiet, Hesper took her
work and sat down by the fire, while Mose bent
studiously over his old geography. Their father
sat by the table writing as usual, and their mother
was asleep. Not a word was spoken for a long
time. At last the clock struck eight and Mose
looked up as if a thought had suddenly occurred
to him.</p>

<p>“Father,” said he, “if I could get a first rate
chance to go to sea, should you be willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“What!” said his father, dropping his pen and
looking him full in the face.</p>

<p>Mose repeated his question.</p>

<p>“Do you know of any such chance?” asked his
father.</p>

<p>“Yes sir.” And then Mose told his whole conversation
with Capt. Clark. He waited for his
father to reply, but he did not. Mr. Greyson
silently reached up for his hat, took his cane and
went out. Hesper was so disappointed she could
not speak. Mose thrust his old geography into
his pocket with a vexed and angry movement.</p>

<p>“There!” said he, “I might have known it
would be so! How foolish I was ever to have hoped
for anything better! Now all I have to do is to go
back to the mill again, and work like a slave till it
kills me, which will not take long, and the sooner I
die the better.”</p>

<p>He spoke bitterly, for he was sadly disappointed.</p>

<p>“Mose! Mose!” said a gentle voice. He turned
and saw that his mother had risen from her
pillow, and was resting upon one arm. The striking
of the clock awoke her, and she had heard all.
Just then, as the light shone upon her face, showing
the smooth black hair parted on her white
forehead, and her large dark eyes in which there
was such tender sadness, she looked very beautiful.
Mose went, and kneeling down beside her
bed, hid his face in her pillow. She laid her hand
gently on his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be discouraged my poor boy,” said she.
“The greater the trouble, the nearer is God, and
I know that He will aid you if you do not despair.”</p>

<p>Her low sweet voice and gentle touch, was like
oil upon the troubled waves, and though the poor
boy’s frame shook with emotions which were hard
to control, yet beneath her soothing influence, he
at length became calm. When the first bitterness
of his disappointment had passed, he raised his
face, and kissing his mother’s pale cheek with all
that affection which had strengthened and deepened
from his childhood, he went back to his reading.
It was nearly an hour before their father
returned. Mose and Hesper were still sitting by
the fire. He did not tell them that he had seen
Capt. Clark, but he had been with him all the
time.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said he abruptly, “are you willing
that Mose should go to sea?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir;” she replied meekly and without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Do you consider, at the same time,” he asked,
“that the work will be harder and heavier for
you&mdash;that there will be more care, and one the
less to labor?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir; but I am willing to do and bear any
thing if he can only go, for it will certainly kill
him if he works in the mill much longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“But,” he continued, “supposing that your
mother should be worse&mdash;perhaps die, and I
should be taken sick, what would become of us
then?”</p>

<p>Hesper’s eyes filled with tears and her lips quivered&mdash;“I
don’t know sir,” said she, “but I think
the Lord would care for us.”</p>

<p>“Poor, simple child!” said her father&mdash;“there
are a great many people left to the care of the
Lord, who perish miserably. Think of the fathers,
and mothers, and little children, who die for want
of bread, and of the wretched beings in our great
cities, with scarce a mouthful of food and no
shelter from the heat of summer, or the piercing
cold of winter. Does the Lord care for them?”</p>

<p>Hesper was silent a few moments, and then a
great thought stirred her heart, sending the blood
to her cheeks, and the brightness to her eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know sir,” said she, “why such dreadful
things happen, but I do know that when I have
said the Lord would help me, and have given all
up to Him that He always has. I would not like
to starve, but if I should, I would try to be patient,
for God alone knows what is best.”</p>

<p>Her father looked at her in astonishment. He
did not speak, but he leaned his face upon his
hands. He thought of the time when he was a
little child and went with his father to the church.
Heaven seemed very near him then, and God both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
good and great. Hesper’s simple words had
touched his better feelings. He longed to be a
child once more, and feel that confidence in the
heavenly Father’s love, which he had once known.
When he spoke again his manner was greatly
changed.</p>

<p>“Mose,” said he, “if you want to go to sea, I
am perfectly willing. You have a first rate
chance, and ought to improve it.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">A BUSY TIME.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">A few</span> mornings after this conversation, Mrs.
Grimsby made her appearance in Hesper’s room.
She had been listening for some time, and as soon
as she heard Mr. Greyson leave, she took her
hands out of the wash-tub, and came in with her
arms all smoking.</p>

<p>“So,” she commenced, “I hear that Mose is
going to sea. I shouldn’t have known it if one of
the neighbors hadn’t told me. It’s rather strange,
living in the same house, and doing all I can to be
friendly, that everything should be kept so private.
If I had been aunt Nyna, or Capt. Clark’s
mother, or some of those people who set themselves
up so, perhaps it would have been different.
But I don’t know as I care&mdash;I am certain of one
thing, that I am an honest woman, and the time
will come when I shall have the place I deserve.”</p>

<p>“O,” said Hesper, with a smile, “I thought
several times about coming in to tell you but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
have been so busy with getting things ready for
Mose, and finding out what he needed, that I really
had no chance.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Grimsby, “if you had only
come in and asked me, I could have told you all
about it, for I fitted out my husband for California
all myself. But howsomever, I shan’t offer my
services. I know better than to throw away my
good will upon those that don’t know how to prize
it.”</p>

<p>Hesper did not answer, so Mrs. Grimsby made
bold to walk about the room, examine everything,
and ask a great many questions.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she at last, after she had opened
the door, and was just ready to step out. “I
thought I would just drop in and tell you, that if
you wanted anything of me, you will find me
ready and willing, even though I should stay at
home from my work to help you”&mdash;and she shut
the door before Hesper could have a chance to
thank her.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone, Hesper arose and put
her handkerchief over her head to run up to aunt
Betsey’s. There was so much to be done for
Mose, that it was quite impossible for her to attend
to it all. She had good judgment for one so
young, but she lacked experience, and even now,
her head ached with thinking and her eyes with
weariness. Aunt Nyna was doing all she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
for her, but even this was not enough. The time
was short, another pair of hands was greatly needed,
and Hesper resolved at last to apply to aunt
Betsey. She went in very doubtfully, and found
her sewing as usual upon her bed-quilt. It didn’t
seem to grow very fast, with all her labor. Hesper
sat down beside her. Snip, snip, snip, went
aunt Betsey’s scissors, as she cut out a fresh supply
of diamonds from the bits of satin, and then
she began to stitch away again with all her might.
They talked upon various subjects for some time,
till at last Hesper summoned courage to ask her.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” said aunt Betsey, “I don’t see
how it will be possible! I am in such a hurry! I
declare, I am obliged to work night and day! Why
don’t you hire some one?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know of any one,” said Hesper,
“even if we could afford to.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said aunt Betsey, “what, with my
housework, and my bed-quilt, and the things I have
to attend to, and all the rest, it will be quite out of
my power. You must take the will for the deed,
and I will make Mose some present which will do
quite as well.” Hesper came away greatly disheartened.
She wondered how aunt Betsey could
be so selfish, and then she thought it was because
she had nothing else to care for but herself and
her own comfort.</p>

<p>“O dear,” she said, “it is better to be poor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
have a warm heart. Maybe if I was in her place,
though, that I should be a great deal more selfish.”
She went home and seated herself again to her
work, resolved to do the best she could without
assistance. It was not long before Juliana came
in with Tommy in her arms.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said she, “mother says she thinks I
can help you a little, if I try, for I can sew quite
fast. I don’t know much about making things,
but I can always learn when I have a mind to, and
I am sure I would do any thing to help you.” She
put Tommy on the floor to play with simple
Johnny, and then took her seat by Hesper. She
had brought her thimble with her and went to
work directly. At first she was awkward, and had
to be told a great many things, but she soon
learned, and then was quicker with her needle
than Hesper.</p>

<p>“How strange it is,” said Hesper, “when I get
almost discouraged, something always happens to
cheer me. Do you know, Juliana, I was just
ready to cry when you came in this morning?”
The sullen expression which usually hung about
Juliana’s face, vanished in a moment, and she
looked up with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said she, “I find it the easiest thing
in the world to labor for those I love, and if I can
do anything to make you love me, it will be all I
want.” That night they could scarce believe they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
had done so much. The work seemed to have
grown under their hands without their knowing
it, and they had enjoyed every moment. After
this, Juliana insisted upon helping Hesper till the
work was all finished. Mrs. Grimsby said the
reason why she was so willing, was because she
thought Hesper a little better than her own folks,
and as soon as Tommy was old enough to leave
with the boys, she meant to take Juliana out a
washing with her.</p>

<p>As Mose was not obliged to work in the mill
now, he improved all his leisure time by making
himself busy about the house, doing all he could
for their comfort and convenience. Uncle Nathan
had promised him a load of wood for the family,
and Capt. Clark offered to lend him his horse and
wagon to go after it, so one pleasant morning he
took Fred and Charlie with him, and started for
the wood-lot. On their way they met George and
Benny Grimsby.</p>

<p>“Jump in,” said Mose, “if you wish to,” and
they did not wait for a second invitation. When
they came to the wood-lot they went to work with
all possible diligence to fill the cart. Mose praised
them, and they worked all the faster.</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” said George, who felt very good-natured,
“that you are going away so soon, Mose.
I like you first rate, and I don’t know what we
shall do without you.” Mose laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“George,” said he, “when I am gone, you will
be the oldest boy in the house, so you must take
good care of the others. Be kind to Hesper, won’t
you? and if Fred and Charlie are troublesome, or
do anything to vex you, don’t take any notice of
them, and they will soon learn better.”</p>

<p>“No,” said George, with great dignity, “we
used to quarrel and fight once, but we have given
that up long ago.” To be sure, six weeks seemed
quite an age to such a boy, but it was no longer
ago than that, since the Greysons and Grimsbys
had a serious battle, in which the Greysons were
severely beaten. Mose had been wanting, for a
long time, to get an opportunity to talk with
George, and though he placed little confidence in
his promises, yet he was glad if he would think
about it.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mose, “if you will be a first rate
boy, and do all you can for Hesper, I will bring
you home something that will please you.”</p>

<p>George began to wonder immediately what it
would be, and he thought it would be no harm to
modestly suggest, that he would like either a
monkey or a Chinese umbrella&mdash;he wasn’t very
particular which&mdash;but of the two, he should prefer
a monkey. After this, the boys followed Mose
as closely as his own shadow. They told their
mother what he had promised, and asked her if
she didn’t think they had best sell their ducks, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
as to keep the monkey in the duck-house, but she
quite disconcerted them by calling them little
simpletons, and telling them they had best wait till
they had it. By the untiring industry of Hesper
and Juliana, everything was at length made ready.
Mrs. Grimsby, out of pure good will, washed all
the clothes they made, ironed them neatly, and
stowed them away in the chest they were to
occupy, but she told all the neighbors of it, and
said that she shouldn’t have done it if she could
have well helped it. Aunt Nyna made Mose a
present of a very nicely bound Bible, and aunt
Betsey brought him a large bundle of old newspapers,
which she had begged of a neighbor. The
night previous to his departure, there came a loud
rap at the door, and upon opening it, Mose beheld
Mr. Byers’ benevolent countenance.</p>

<p>“Get your hat, my boy,” said he, “and go to
walk with me. My heart is full and I want to
relieve it.”</p>

<p>Accordingly Mose complied with his request,
and they turned their steps towards the sea shore.
As they seated themselves on an unfinished spar,
Mr. Byers asked if the ship in which Mose was to
sail would touch at Canton.</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe so,” replied Mose, “at some
time in the course of the voyage, for we are to be
gone two years or more, and shall visit several
ports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” resumed Mr. Byers, “doubtless
you will meet with Harry Nyna, and I want you,
Mose, to take a sharp observation of that young
man, for if I can trust anything to my knowledge
of human nature, I should say he was exceedingly
progressive.”</p>

<p>“Progressive!” repeated Mose. “Well, why
not?”</p>

<p>“Ay, let me tell you, I think a young man is
altogether too progressive, when, at the age of
seventeen or eighteen, he smokes his cigar in public,
drinks brandy behind the barn-door, and plays
cards on the hay-mow.”</p>

<p>“What!” said Mose, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s a fact; and his mother&mdash;dear good
lady,&mdash;never suspected it. She’s just like all the
rest of the women&mdash;Lord bless ‘em! So good
themselves they think everybody else is, and
whoever they love, is next kin to perfection.”</p>

<p>“Harry is a good-hearted boy, though” said
Mose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“As good as a ripe October peach with a
doubled kernelled pit in it, and generous as summer
sunshine. But that is the great difficulty
with him. He is too generous to say no, and goes
in for a jolly time whenever he can have one.
Nevertheless, I love him with all his faults, and
really feel a fatherly solicitude for him. Not on
his mother’s account, however. O, no, Mose! no!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
It’s purely for his own sake, although I think Mrs.
Dorothy a most excellent woman, and should I
ever think of marrying again, I would certainly
give her the preference. But, then, that isn’t
what I came here to talk about. Mose,” resumed
the old man, after a few moment’s silence,
“you are to be gone a long time, and perhaps I
may never see you again, and possibly I may be
dead when you come back.”</p>

<p>“O, I don’t think so,” said Mose.</p>

<p>“Nor I either,” continued Mr. Byers. “I only
said possibly, and as I would like to be remembered,
I have concluded to give you this;” so
saying, he drew a monstrous old silver watch from
his pocket, and laid it in the hand of his young
friend.</p>

<p>Mose drew back, unwilling to accept of a gift
which he knew was of so much value to its possessor,
but the old man urged it upon him.</p>

<p>“Take her, Mose,” said he in a husky voice.
“She’s a faithful creature, and worth a dozen of
the new-fangled concerns they have now-a-days.
She’s just what a good woman ought to be, for she
has more of inward worth than outward beauty,
She never wears any other than a cheerful countenance
and always keeps her hands busy. Take
her, my boy, I had rather give her to you than
any one. Whenever you look at her, think how
fast time is travelling on to eternity, and may the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Lord teach you to so number your days as to apply
your heart to wisdom.”</p>

<p>Mose did take the watch, thanking him most
sincerely, for he knew the old man’s feelings
would be deeply wounded, should he persist in refusing.</p>

<p>“Now Mose, my boy,” he added, “I am going.
You needn’t walk home with me, for my heart is
full, and I want to shed a few tears by myself.
Good bye, and God bless you.” He seized Mose
warmly by the hand, and giving it a hearty shake,
he turned away, walked quickly up the sands and
disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>The morning on which Mose was to take his departure
had at length arrived. The “Sea Gull,”
as handsome a ship as ever rode the waves, lay at
anchor in the harbor below. A fine fresh breeze
was blowing, and the boat was waiting at the
wharf to take Mose and several others on board.
Mr. Greyson’s foot was so much worse that he
could not go out, and therefore Mose took leave of
his parents at the house. He told his father to
keep up a good heart and take the best of care
of himself till he came home, and then they should
all live more comfortably. But Mr. Greyson
shook his head with a most melancholy look and
turned away as he faintly said, “Good bye.”</p>

<p>Next Mose kissed his mother, and when she
lifted her calm, pale face to his, and said so earnestly&mdash;“God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
bless you, my boy, and keep you
from all evil”&mdash;he could not restrain the tears
that were almost choking him, and he had to wipe
his eyes a great many times before he dared make
his appearance at the door. Capt Clark was waiting
for him with his wagon, to take his sea-chest
and other things down to the boat. As the wagon
was large, they took Hesper and simple Johnny
in, and then Capt. Clark called to Juliana, who
stood in the door-way with Tommy in her arms, to
come too, which she did with as little delay as possible.
When all was ready they drove off, while
Fred and Charlie, with the Grimsby boys and
Bose, followed behind.</p>

<p>They soon came to the wharf, and Capt. Clark
took charge of the baggage, leaving Mose to talk
with the friends who had come to see him off.
Hesper shivered like a leaf as she stood on the
wharf, holding simple Johnny by the hand, for the
morning was cold, and her heart was heavy within
her. She thought how lonely she should be without
Mose, and in spite of herself the tears would
roll down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Hesper!” he said, cheerfully; but
there his own heart failed him, and the choking
feeling came again. So he only kissed her and,
whispered&mdash;“Pray for me every night, sister.”
Then he jumped into the boat and they pushed off.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” cried some one at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the wharf, and looking up, they saw Mrs. Grimsby
coming in great haste, with a bundle in her hand.</p>

<p>“Here,” she said, as she tossed it to Mose, “is
a little package of medicine which I meant to have
given you before. There are old linen rags, and
salve, and pills, and powders, and anything else
you will want, should you be sick, and if you don’t
need them, why some one else may.”</p>

<p>“That’s a wise woman,” cried out the Captain
of the ship, who stood in the bow of the boat.
“Three cheers for the ladies!” and they all took
off their hats and hurrahed, which pleased Mrs.
Grimsby very much.</p>

<p>The boys followed the boat down to the end of
the wharf, where they waited to see her reach the
ship. George made up a sorry face to cry, when
suddenly a thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>“Mose!” he called out at the top of his voice,
“don’t forget the monkey!” Mose laughed outright&mdash;“Don’t
forget your promise!” he shouted
in reply, and then the boat shot out beyond
hearing.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">AUNT BETSEY UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Uncle Nathan’s</span> orchard was a long distance
from his house, and adjoined aunt Nyna’s garden.
When the apples were ripe enough to gather and
put up for sale, uncle Nathan employed both the
Greysons and Grimsbys, and aunt Betsey came
down, of her own accord, to see that the boys did
not carry away any, and also to take particular
care that they put a good proportion of the small
ones into the barrels intended for market. There
was quite a high stone wall between the orchard
and aunt Nyna’s garden, and close beside this wall,
in the garden, grew a famous peach tree. It was
a source of great profit to aunt Nyna, for the
peaches were very large and luscious, and always
commanded a very high price.</p>

<p>One day, during the apple gathering, aunt Betsey
stood by the wall and regarded the peach tree
with a longing gaze. She glanced down at the
wall and then up to the tree, and measured with
her eye, as though she was revolving a subject of
great importance in her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nathan,” said she to her husband, “doesn’t
that branch of the tree hang over the wall?”</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;yes&mdash;a little,” he replied, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Then,” said aunt Betsey, with an eager look,
“according to law and common custom, all the
peaches on it belong to us, and I wish you would
send up one of the boys to gather them.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t do any such thing!” said uncle Nathan,
decidedly.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” she replied, “if you won’t, I
will; for what’s ours is ours, and I’ll have it at
any rate.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you will!” said uncle Nathan in surprise;
“I wouldn’t touch one of those peaches for
my right hand, and what’s more, I tell you not to.”
It was very seldom that he spoke in such an
authoritative manner, and therefore aunt Betsey
was considerably disconcerted. She said nothing
more, but secretly resolved that have the peaches
she would, and as it was high time they were
gathered, she felt that the sooner she secured her
part the better. That afternoon she had the minister
and his wife to tea. She put on her best
black silk dress, which she had kept very carefully
for more than ten years. She also put on her
blandest expression of countenance, and talked so
piously that the minister and his wife supposed her
to be a perfect model of goodness and propriety.
It was sometime after nine when her visitors left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and as uncle Nathan was very much fatigued, he
retired immediately, leaving aunt Betsey at her
sewing.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought she to herself, “as there is
such a clear, bright moon, I will just run over and
get those peaches.” She took her basket and
hastened forth, but had not proceeded far, when
she bethought herself that she had on her very best
dress. For a few moments she hesitated, and
almost made up her mind to go back and change
it, but the fear that she should get hindered or
discovered, decided her to keep on and risk the
consequences. The way was long and lonely, but
aunt Betsey was a very resolute woman, and would
go through fire and water to accomplish her purpose.
Arriving at the orchard, she crossed it very
quickly&mdash;mounted the stone wall, and laying hold
of the branch, had already deposited several of the
peaches in her basket, when she heard a fierce
growl, and the next moment Bose seized her by
the leg.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” exclaimed aunt Betsey, as she
tumbled down on the wall, all in a heap&mdash;“O
Bose! you dear, good dog! How you frightened
me! Let go of me, Bose! do, there’s a good fellow!
Oh! Oh! Why, I’m aunt Betsey, don’t
you know me!” But just then, Bose seemed to
be no respecter of persons, and the only proof he
gave of his goodness, was that of letting go of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
leg and seizing her by the dress, which he shook
fiercely, rending and tearing it in the most shocking
manner. Every thread which gave way,
seemed to draw right from aunt Betsey’s heart,
but there was no helping it. She attempted to
conciliate Bose by patting him, but it rather
appeared to increase his fury, and to all her terms
of affection and endearment, he only answered by
significant growls.</p>

<p>“O dear!” she exclaimed at length, “what
shall I do! I never saw such a savage, unmanageable
brute in my life!” She sat still for some
time, and the dog gradually loosened his hold.
She felt greatly relieved, and drew up her feet
gently to spring from the wall; but the moment
she did so, Bose seized her dress in a new place,
and tore it most shockingly. Aunt Betsey grew
desperate.</p>

<p>“Begone! you villain you!” she exclaimed, as
she beat the dog upon his head with her basket.
She discovered immediately, however, that this
was an altogether mistaken movement, for Bose
seized her at once by the arm, and set his teeth so
firmly that she cried out with pain.</p>

<p>“O merciful Heaven!” she moaned, “I believe
I have done wrong, or I never should be punished
so terribly. But O, Lord!” she added devoutly,
with uplifted hands&mdash;“if thou wilt only bring me
out of this difficulty, I never will do the like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
again.” Even her prayers, though, seemed just
then to be unavailing, for the dog would not let
her stir an inch. If she remained quiet any length
of time, Bose sat down beside her, but the moment
she started he seized her again. At one time, she
attempted to cry out for assistance, but at this
Bose became perfectly furious, and therefore she
desisted.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she at length, after she had been
sitting upon the wall for about two hours, and saw
no prospect whatever of an escape&mdash;“I suppose I
have got to sit here till morning, and how much
longer nobody knows, for this horrid brute acts as
if he was possessed. I declare I wish this peach
tree had been in Sodom before ever I touched it.
What a pretty sight I shall be, going home by
broad daylight, with my dress all in tatters!” and
she began to cry in good earnest.</p>

<p>The dew and the chilly night air made her
shiver, but Bose seemed to resent even the movement
that she made to draw her shawl around
her.</p>

<p>After sitting quiet for a long time, she heard the
village clock strike twelve. Once more she
attempted to slip stealthily from the wall, but
again she was rudely detained by her watchful
sentinel. Moaning and sobbing in utter despair,
she concluded to submit, and wait till morning
should bring relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, however, a most alarming sound fell
upon her ear. It was the village bells ringing
briskly, as if for fire. She bethought herself directly,
that in her haste, she had left some blazing
brands upon her hearth, and that in consequence
perhaps her own house might now be in flames.
The thought made her almost distracted, but she
dared not make the least movement to depart.</p>

<p>Once more she listened intently, and distinguished
a confused sound of voices. Sometimes
there appeared to be only a single one, and then
to be many. Again they would seem to come
near, and then go a great way off. The shouting,
also, was not in the least like the cry of fire, and
therefore she did not know how to understand it.
She began to think, at last, that she had suddenly
become deranged, and all this noise and confusion
existed only in her imagination. It was not long,
however, before she discovered lights glancing
among the trees, and soon saw a party of men,
with lanterns in their hands, coming through the
orchard, directly towards her. Again she began
to wonder what all this could mean, when her
imagination suggested that some bloody deed had
been committed in the village, and now they were
out in quest of the perpetrator. A thrill of horror
passed over her, and as the men came nearer she
ventured to call out to them.</p>

<p>“O, here she is! here she is!” they all shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
at once, as they hastened towards her, and immediately
they blew a terrible blast on the fish horns
they carried with them, as a signal to others that
the object of their search was found. Mr. Byers
was the foremost of the group; and in his company
were the minister, doctor, lawyer, schoolmaster,
two deacons, the town clerk, and the editor of the
village paper.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Hastings!” said Mr. Byers, as he
held up his lantern and surveyed her&mdash;“how
came you here?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied aunt Betsey, trying to put on a
fair face before this honorable company&mdash;“you
see my husband has been putting up his apples,
and as he left all the barrels in the orchard, I
thought I would just take a run down before I
went to bed, to see that all was safe, when the first
thing I knew this horrible dog laid hold of me,
and has kept me here ever since.”</p>

<p>Mr. Byers held his lantern over the wall. Bose
sprang up to him, wagging his tail and looking
delighted, as if conscious he had done his duty.
Then, seizing aunt Betsey’s basket in his teeth, he
shook it with a fierce growl, scattering the few
peaches that yet remained in it.</p>

<p>“O, ho!” said Mr. Byers, “it is very easy to
see through all this, now that we have a little light
on the subject. How happened it, Mrs. Hastings,
that the widow’s peaches lodged in your basket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Byers,” returned aunt Betsey,
tartly, “if you must know, I will tell you. Please
hold up your lantern, and if you look carefully,
you will perceive that one branch of that tree
hangs a little over our orchard; therefore all the
fruit on it belongs, by good rights, to us. I thought,
since I was down here, I might as well take them
now as at any time, and I defy all the world to
find fault with me. What’s right is right, anyhow,
let people say what they will.”</p>

<p>Aunt Betsey had stepped down from the wall,
and now stood before them with her dress all in
tatters, her arms akimbo, and her head thrust
forward, looking the very picture of defiance.</p>

<p>“Woman!” said Mr. Byers, gravely, as he gave
her a contemptuous poke with his cane&mdash;“I am
ashamed of you! you are a disgrace to humanity
in general, and your sex in particular. What is
legally right is not always morally so; and for you,
with your abundance, to steal peaches from a poor
widow woman, is, to say the least, a sin in the
sight of God, for which you have been justly
punished.”</p>

<p>“Friends!” he added in a louder tone, as he
turned to the group behind him, which had gradually
augmented till the whole population of the
village seemed to be present, “this woman is more
to be pitied than blamed, for to carry such a narrow
contracted heart in the bosom, is the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
curse that can fall upon any human being, and
for the sake of that Christian charity which thinketh
no evil, let us hush the matter up as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the editor, significantly, “I shall
hush it up according to my usual custom. I have
a very excellent method of disposing of such
matters.”</p>

<p>Aunt Betsey burst into tears. Her husband
came up and offered his arm. She took it and
walked home, accompanied by such an escort as
no woman in the village ever had before. Behind
and before her went her neighbors and friends,
talking over the matter with perfect freedom; and
from their remarks the unhappy woman had not
the least reason to doubt, that although they
compassionated her sincerely, yet her inconsiderate
act met with their unqualified condemnation.
From that day (or we should rather say night)
forth, aunt Betsey considered herself hopelessly
disgraced in the eyes of the whole village, and to
the end of her life, the very mention of peaches
made her shudder. How true is it, that the ruling
passion of one’s nature, however carefully guarded,
will at some time or other betray itself.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">SIMPLE JOHNNY.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was very hard for Hesper to keep up her
courage and go about her work as usual, now that
Mose was gone. Her father was more desponding
than ever, and though her mother seemed cheerful,
yet it was very evident that she had to make
a great effort to be so. Every night, when Hesper
laid her head upon her pillow, she felt that she
would like to have a good long cry, but she resolutely
kept back the tears, for she knew if she
once began, she would soon become so disheartened
that she could not attend to anything properly.
So she remembered the last words of Mose, and
consoled herself by doing as he had told her&mdash;to
pray for him every night. These seemed to Hesper
the darkest days she had ever known. Capt.
Clark still remained a true and faithful friend
and this kept her from wholly despairing. He
did not often visit them, but out of his abundance,
he gave them many things, without which they
would actually have suffered. Yet even with his
help, the prospect was very discouraging, and Hesper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
puzzled her brains night and day, to think of
something she could do to earn a little money.
Her mother needed medicine and comfortable
food, and the boys’ clothes were getting sadly out
of repair. Her father still had writing to do, but
he only earned enough by this to pay the rent.
His foot troubled him constantly, for he could not
be patient till it got well, but he hobbled about
on it every day, and thus made it a great deal
worse. Beside this, his general health was very
poor, and he always looked on the dark side of
everything, which made him unhappy and discontented.
He said very little, but one could easily
tell by his gloomy countenance how he felt.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon, as Hesper was returning
home with simple Johnny, who had been spending
the day with aunt Nyna, she was overtaken by
Mrs. Grimsby. The poor woman looked very tired,
for her day’s work had been hard. Under one
arm she carried her old wash-gown, and on the
other was a large basket of clothes she was taking
home to iron.</p>

<p>“O dear,” she said, “I feel as though I could
not take another step! I don’t believe there’s a
slave at the South that has to work harder than I.
But then I get my pay for it, and in these hard
times that is a great comfort.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hesper, “I would like to go out
a washing myself, if I were able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“You poor little thing!” said Mrs. Grimsby, in
a tone of unusual kindness&mdash;“I’m glad you
can’t, for you would work yourself almost to
death. Why don’t you keep school, Hesper?”</p>

<p>This was a new thought, and for a moment
Hesper’s heart beat quicker, but then it occurred
to her directly, that she had no room, and she
shook her head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “neither father or mother
could bear the noise of the children at home, and
there is no other place.”</p>

<p>“Fie!” said Mrs. Grimsby, “that is no excuse
at all, for you can have my back kitchen just as
well as not, and be right welcome, if you will take
George and Benny and keep them out of mischief.
I’m scarce ever at home, and if I was, the
school would not trouble me at all. Come now,
you had best take up with my offer at once, and
to-morrow when I go out to work, I will look up
some scholars for you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hesper, without hesitation, “I
will, though I hardly know how to thank you
enough for your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Fie!” said Mrs. Grimsby, with seeming impatience,
“I only do it for my own convenience, so
you needn’t say anything more about it.”</p>

<p>Just then they reached home, and Mrs. Grimsby
went directly into her own room, leaving
Hesper with a hopeful heart and smiling countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>At the beginning of the next week the school
was opened. There were eight scholars besides
Fred and Charlie and the Grimsby boys. Juliana
knew very little about reading and spelling, so she
improved the opportunity, and soon was able to
assist Hesper, which she did very willingly. As
for simple Johnny, he could not be persuaded to
stay in the school, so Hesper let him go out to
play as he had been in the habit of doing. He
knew very well how to take care of himself,
Moreover, he had such an innocent expression of
countenance, and was so gentle and inoffensive,
that every one was kind to him. At first Hesper
used to worry a great deal about him, but she soon
became accustomed to having him away. He
never went far from home, and almost always returned
at the right time. They could easily tell
where he had been by the little tokens he brought
back. Sometimes he would have a pinafore full
of blocks from the ship-yard&mdash;a bunch of field
flowers, or a handful of smooth white pebbles
gathered on the seashore. But of late, he had
puzzled them, for he had returned several times
with a most beautiful bouquet of choice garden
flowers, tastefully arranged and tied with a string,
and sometimes with his little basket full of ripe,
rosy apples and peaches.</p>

<p>“Who could be so good to him?” said Hesper;
“it must be some lady, I know.” But the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
child could not tell, so the matter remained a
mystery. One night he was out later than usual.
The weather was now quite cold, so that Hesper
felt all the more anxious. She wrapped her mother’s
shawl about her, and went out in search of
him, though she did not feel much alarmed, for
she expected every moment to meet him. First
she went to the ship-yard and along the seashore.
Next to Capt. Clark’s, where a large party of boys
were husking corn&mdash;then to uncle Nathan’s and
aunt Nyna’s, but he could not be found at any of
these places. It was now almost dark. The wind
was cold and chilly, and a few light flakes of snow
were falling. Hesper’s heart beat quickly, and
she ran home as fast as possible to see if he was
there, but nothing had been seen of him. Again
she hastened forth, questioning the people along
the street, but they could give her no information.
At length she met a little fellow, who told her he
saw Johnny not long before dark, gathering acorns
in the wood beyond the Rolling Mill. Away she
flew as fast as her feet would carry her, and was
soon ranging about in the midst of the wood. It
was so dark among the trees she could not see the
way before her&mdash;- the briers laid fast hold of her&mdash;she
stumbled over the roots in her pathway, and
finally lost one shoe in the low, swampy ground,
whither she had unconsciously wandered, yet still
she urged her way onward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Johnny! Johnny!” she called at the top of
her voice, in the hope that he might make some
sound in reply. She stopped to listen, but heard
nothing save the mournful sighing of the winds
among the pines, and the falling of withered
leaves around her. She seemed utterly alone and
desolate, and her heart failed her.</p>

<p>“O, merciful Father!” she exclaimed, “what
shall I do!” and she burst into tears. Again she
struggled onward in the midst of the darkness, till
she came to the roadside. There, trembling with
cold and excitement, she knelt down beneath a
spreading oak, and lifting her hands, she cried
out&mdash;</p>

<p>“O, Father in heaven! I pray thee to take pity
on me and help me.” As she spoke, a bright light
flashed upon her face, and looking out from the
overhanging branches, she saw a man passing with
a lantern.</p>

<p>“O, sir!” she exclaimed, as she sprang forward,
“will you help me find my brother? He is lost
in these woods, and it is so dark I cannot see one
step before me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly! certainly!” he replied in a very
friendly manner. “In these woods did you say?
and how old a child?”</p>

<p>“About ten years, sir. Poor Johnny, he is a
simple child, yet nevertheless he is very dear
to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the gentleman&mdash;“he must be
the same child who has been to my house so often
of late, and to whom my Kate and Alice took such
a fancy. I will go with you by all means,” and
he immediately led the way into the wood. He
held up his lantern, looking carefully about, and
calling at short intervals&mdash;but they heard no
sound in reply. Hesper never seemed so weak
and faint-hearted before. She wept like a child,
and had it not been for the encouraging words of
her unknown friend, she would have despaired of
ever seeing Johnny again. She soon discovered
from the gentleman’s speech, that he was the new
doctor, of whose skill and kindness she had heard
so much. He was very wealthy, and had always
lived in the city till the past year, when he purchased
an elegant residence in this town. She
knew from what people had said, that he was very
benevolent, and would do all he could to assist
her. After they had searched through the wood
in various directions, they went down over the
other side of the hill, where there was a low,
swampy hollow, not far from aunt Nyna’s. Here
the bushes and trees grew very closely, and the
long ivy vines interlaced the whole in such a
manner, that it formed an almost impenetrable
thicket. As the doctor held up his lantern and
looked before him, he seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>“Really,” he said, “if the poor child is here, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
will be almost impossible to find him. I think, on
the whole, we had best go back and get other
assistance.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Hesper felt something rub against
her. She looked down, and to her inexpressible
joy, beheld Bose, standing close beside her, wagging
his tail and seeming very happy that he had met
with her.</p>

<p>“O here, sir!” she called out to the doctor, “is
this faithful old dog, and he will find him if anybody.
I would trust him sooner than I would
myself.”</p>

<p>“Here, Bose!” she continued, pointing to the
thicket&mdash;“Johnny! Johnny!” Bose started in
the direction in which she pointed, scenting the
air keenly. Then he ran back again to Hesper,
wagging his tail, and looking up in her face wistfully,
as if very desirous of doing her will exactly,
if he only knew what it was. She went with him
then to the borders of the thicket, and pointing in
again, called out, “Johnny! Johnny!” with all
possible earnestness.</p>

<p>In sprang the dog at once, and she could hear
the under-brush cracking beneath his feet, and the
branches sweeping by him as he passed. After a
few moments the doctor called again, and then, as
they stopped to listen, they seemed to hear the
sound of a child crying. Directly, out rushed
Bose like a mad creature, and seizing Hesper by
the frock, pulled her after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“O, he has found him! he has found him!”
she exclaimed, and was about to spring at once
into the thicket, when the doctor withheld her.</p>

<p>“Let me go first, with my lantern,” he said,
“while you remain here, for I think I can be of
more service to him than you, poor child.”</p>

<p>He turned his steps in the direction whence the
sound had proceeded, and in a few moments,
guided by Bose, found simple Johnny lying flat on
his face, moaning and weeping most piteously.
The child’s hat and little basket of acorns were
upon the ground beside him, as though he had
accidentally fallen asleep there. The doctor raised
him up, and spoke to him kindly. He brushed
away the long, wet ringlets from the poor child’s
face&mdash;put his hat upon his head, gave him his
basket, and then led him out to the place where
Hesper was anxiously awaiting them.</p>

<p>The instant the poor child recognized her, he
uttered a cry of joy. He seized her by the dress,
and laying his head against her, made the low
soothing sound he usually did when pleased. Hesper,
unlike herself, scarce knew what she said or
did, but when she minded how damp the child’s
clothes were, and how he shivered with cold, she
took off her great warm shawl and wrapped it
closely about him. As they all three walked home
together, the doctor asked her a great many questions
about herself and family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Miss Hesper,” he said at last, as he was
about to leave her, “I am right glad that I have
met with you, and shall endeavor to see you again,
very soon.” He stooped down and kissed Johnny,
and as he turned away, he dropped something
into his basket, which afterwards proved to be a
bright golden eagle.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SHEPHERD’S CALL.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was only a few evenings after Johnny’s adventure
in the wood, that Hesper stood hesitating
and trembling on the great stone steps at the doctor’s
front door. She raised her hand to the silver
bell knob, and then withdrew it, as if her courage
failed her.</p>

<p>“No,” said she at last, “I will not fear, for I
am doing right, and I know he is too kind to
refuse me.” She did not allow herself another
moment for reflection, but gave the bell quite a
vigorous pull. In a few moments a great red
faced Irish girl came to the door.</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am,” said Hesper, dropping a very
respectful curtsey&mdash;“Is Dr. Smiley in?”</p>

<p>“No;” said the girl, and she was just shutting
the door, when a pleasant voice called out from
the parlor&mdash;</p>

<p>“Stop, Ellen; he came in just now, and went
up to the library.” The next moment, a very
pretty young lady stepped into the entry.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said, “and I will speak to
father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Hesper timidly crossed the threshold, and stood
in one corner. “I will wait here,” she said, in a
very humble manner, “if you will be so kind as
to tell the doctor that Hesper Greyson wishes to
see him.”</p>

<p>“O please do come in,” said the young lady, as
she took Hesper by the hand and led her into the
parlor. “Here is a nice warm fire, and I know
you must be cold.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” she continued, addressing an elderly
lady who was seated by a work-table, sewing&mdash;“Here
is the very Hesper Greyson of whom father
was speaking&mdash;sister to little Johnny.”</p>

<p>There was another young lady&mdash;rather older
than the first&mdash;seated at the piano, who started
up directly when she heard this.</p>

<p>“Let me give her a seat, Alice,” she said,
“while you speak to father.” She drew a velvet
cushioned ottoman to the fire, and Hesper sat
down, though she felt very much out of her element.</p>

<p>“How do you do to-night, my dear?” asked
the elderly lady, who laid down her work and
regarded Hesper with great interest.</p>

<p>“Quite well, I thank you,” replied the poor
girl, though her pale face and sorrowful eyes
seemed to tell a very different story. “It’s my
brother that’s sick ma’am. Poor Johnny! he’s a
simple child, but then we all love him so much,
that it troubles us sadly when anything ails him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“What! Johnny sick!” said the doctor, who
just then entered the room&mdash;“and how long has
that been?”</p>

<p>“Ever since the night he was lost in the wood,
sir. We did not wish to trouble you while we
could do anything ourselves, but indeed, he has
grown sick very fast, and I hope you will not take
it amiss that I have come for you, for there was
no one else to whom I dared go.”</p>

<p>“You have done just right, exactly,” said the
doctor in a most encouraging manner, “and I shall
be right glad to render you every possible service. I
will go with you directly”&mdash;and he went out to
get his hat and coat.</p>

<p>Kate, the eldest daughter, also stepped out of the
room. She soon returned with a very pretty silk
hood in her hand. “Here, Hesper,” she said,
“this is too small for me, and if it will be of any
service to you, you shall be right welcome.” As
she spoke, she stooped down, and loosening the
handkerchief under Hesper’s chin, she tied the
hood upon her head in its place. The poor girl,
worn down by watching and anxiety, had come to
the doctor’s house with many misgivings, and thus
to meet with such unexpected favor and kindness
quite overcame her. She could not speak, but the
great tears, more eloquent than words, chased each
other swiftly down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Dear girl!” said the elderly lady as she took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
off her spectacles and wiped her eyes&mdash;“if there
were more in the world like you, I should want to
spend all my life time in doing good.”</p>

<p>When the Doctor was ready, and Hesper arose
to depart, the young ladies followed her to the
door, assuring her that they should be happy to
assist her in every possible way, and promised to
call next morning and see how little Johnny got
along.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the house, the doctor found
the poor child tossing to and fro upon his bed, in
a small, close room, adjoining the kitchen. It was
a miserable place, but it was the best that could
be afforded. Mrs. Greyson lay upon her own bed
in a corner of the kitchen, and her husband sat by
the fire in one chair, with his foot resting upon
another. Aunt Nyna, who was always a friend in
need, was moving quietly about with her usual
placid look, making everything as neat and orderly
as possible, while Mrs. Grimsby, who had just
brought in a bowl of nice warm gruel for Mrs.
Greyson’s supper, was seated by Johnny’s bed-side.
Fred and Charlie had been sent up to bed some
time previous, but contrary to the supposition of
all, instead of being fast asleep, they were then
sitting mid-way of the stairs, shivering with cold,
but listening intently to all that was passing below.
Hesper regarded the doctor anxiously as he
took Johnny’s hand in his own. The poor child’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
face was crimson with fever&mdash;he moaned and
tossed about constantly, and seemed to be insensible
to all around. The doctor shook his head
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“He is very sick,” he said. “Can you tell me
what you have done for him?”</p>

<p>Aunt Nyna, who had taken upon herself the
responsibility of being his nurse, told him all, with
the greatest precision.</p>

<p>“That is right,” he said, “I could not have
done better myself. But,” he continued, “I must
be frank with you. I fear the poor child is beyond
the reach of medicine. His head has been affected
from his birth, and he has not sufficient vital
energy to meet the trying crisis.”</p>

<p>“Indeed sir!” said Hesper, with a faltering
voice and a face white as the drifted snow&mdash;“I
can’t have our Johnny die.”</p>

<p>“Hesper! Hesper my dear girl!” said aunt
Nyna, as she drew her close to her bosom, “be patient,
and let the Lord’s will be done.”</p>

<p>“Poor little fellow,” said the doctor, in a soft,
sympathizing tone&mdash;“it would indeed be a sad
loss to those who love him, but to him it would be
a most blissful change.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said aunt Betsey, who had just arrived,
and entered the room in time to hear the doctor’s
words&mdash;“I think so too&mdash;you oughtn’t to cry,
Hesper&mdash;nobody ought to. Though it seems a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hard thing to say, yet it would be a mercy to you
all if he should be taken away; for if he should
live to grow up, he would always be a poor miserable
creature.”</p>

<p>Just then, Hesper wished that aunt Betsey was
dead herself, or that she never could hear her
speak again. He “a poor miserable creature!”
Wouldn’t he always be a comfort and consolation
to those who loved him, if he should live a hundred
years? So she reasoned, and she could not
see it otherwise; though when the first gush of
sorrow was over, she felt that the doctor had
spoken truly, and that the better world would give
to the poor child, blessings and powers he never
could enjoy below. She was soon able to restrain
her emotions, and then sat down by his bed as
quietly as before.</p>

<p>After the doctor had given the poor child a
soothing draught&mdash;under the influence of which
he soon fell asleep&mdash;he went out, and began to
talk with Hesper’s father and mother. He stayed
a long time, conversing in a very friendly and
encouraging manner, and offered to do whatever
he could for both of them. Mr. Greyson informed
him, however, with a most melancholy expression
of countenance, that he would never get his pay.
The doctor’s only answer was a good-natured
laugh, and when he left, he promised to call again
next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Hesper did not close her eyes to sleep that
night. She sat by Johnny’s bed-side, carefully
administering his medicines&mdash;soothing him in his
restlessness, and praying that a blessing of healing
might descend upon him from above. The night
seemed very long, and as the clock slowly struck
each passing hour, Hesper grew faint with weariness,
yet she could not be persuaded to leave her
post of duty. Towards morning, however, she
was rejoiced to see that Johnny rested more quietly
upon his pillow&mdash;the fever flush had faded
from his cheek&mdash;his hands grew cool and as he
turned his eyes towards her, he seemed to recognize
her with an almost imperceptible smile,
Her heart was so full of this happy change, that
she could have wept for joy. She longed to speak
to aunt Nyna, but the good old lady was dozing so
peacefully in her chair, that she was not willing to
disturb her. So she stole quietly to the window
and looked out, to see if there were any signs of
morning. The eastern sky was already crimson
with the early light, and the beautiful day-star
was shining clear and bright over the distant
hill-tops. It seemed to Hesper that it was like
the great, cheerful hope which had arisen in her
heart, and she turned from the window with a
joyful countenance.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said aunt Nyna, as she awoke from
her sleep, “how is Johnny now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“O much better,” whispered Hesper. “His fever
has entirely left him, and you cannot think
how still and quiet he lies, though he is very weak,
and breathes so lightly I can scarce hear him.”</p>

<p>Aunt Nyna started up quickly at this, and went
to his bed-side. She looked him earnestly in the
face, and counted the feeble beatings of his pulse.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” she said seriously, “Johnny is no
better. I fear he will leave us very soon.”</p>

<p>Hesper said not a word, though her lips grow
white and she trembled violently. She bent over
the dear child whom she had watched and tended
so carefully, and kissed his pale cheek.</p>

<p>“Johnny, darling,” she said in a low tone, “do
you know me?”</p>

<p>He looked up with a faint smile&mdash;his lips
moved, and he distinctly whispered “Hesper.”
It was the first word the child had ever clearly
spoken, and it was his last, for in a few moments
after, he turned wearily upon his side, and with
one long drawn sigh, the spirit gently departed.</p>

<p>“Poor lamb!” said aunt Nyna, as she brushed away
the damp ringlets from his forehead, and tenderly
closed the long fringed lids&mdash;“he has heard the
Shepherd’s call and gone home to the fold of love.”</p>

<p>But Hesper heard not; she had never looked on
death before, and it was too great a trial for her
loving heart. With a faint moan she sank down
by the bed-side, and when aunt Nyna raised her
up, she found the poor girl had fainted.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NEW HOME.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Many</span> weeks passed by after Johnny’s death,
during which several important changes took
place in the Greyson family, but Hesper was unconscious
of them all, for she was very sick. Her
youthful strength had been so overburdened with
care and anxiety, that she sank beneath it, and a
long and dangerous illness was the result. She
knew nothing of the comforts and conveniences by
which she was surrounded, or who they were that
watched so faithfully by her bed-side. To her the
passing time was one long, dark, troubled dream
to which she saw no ending.</p>

<p>It happened at last, however, that one clear,
bright, winter morning, she awoke from a peaceful
slumber, and opened her eyes as it were on a new
life. She gazed about her in silent wonder, but
saw nothing that would remind her of the past.
The neat and prettily furnished room which she
occupied, was altogether new to her. The bed,
with its covering and curtains of beautifully flowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
chintz&mdash;the nice carpet&mdash;the cozy fire
burning in the grate, and the picture of Christ
with Mary sitting at his feet, above the chimney-piece,
all seemed like objects in a dream. There
was only one thing which had a familiar look, and
that was a great rose-bush, in full bloom, which
stood in the window seat, with the morning sunshine
falling brightly upon it.</p>

<p>“O dear!” sighed Hesper, “I fear that this will
all vanish, and the dark, terrible night come
again.” Then she remembered of having heard
said&mdash;when and where she could not tell&mdash;that
some people believe that when they die, they come
into a world where everything is so much like the
one they have left, that they cannot realize they have
passed through the change called death. So Hesper
thought perhaps this had happened to her, for
she could scarce recollect anything of the past.</p>

<p>The sound of some one moving near her,
attracted her attention, and she was about to
stretch out her arm to draw the bed-curtain aside,
when she found that she was scarce able to move,
and the sight of her own hand, so pale and wasted,
greatly surprised her. In a few moments a door
was opened, and some one asked, in a low tone&mdash;</p>

<p>“How is she this morning?”</p>

<p>“More comfortable, I think,” was the reply.
“Father says that this sleep she has fallen into,
is very refreshing, and he hopes she will be rational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
when she comes out of it.” The curtains were
then drawn aside, and Hesper saw Kate Smiley’s
fair, sweet face, bending over her, while near by
stood Mrs. Grimsby with her bonnet and shawl on.
She had her old wash gown under her arm, as
usual, for she was going out to work, and had only
stopped in a moment to inquire about Hesper.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” said Hesper, “and where are
all the folks, and what has happened to me?”</p>

<p>“O!” exclaimed Kate, “she is wide awake, and
quite herself again! Dear girl! How glad I am!
Do you know that you have been very sick&mdash;so
that we scarce thought you would live? Father
said you would certainly die if you stayed where
you were, so he had you and the family brought
to this house, where you could be more comfortable,
and Alice and I could care for you. Now
I am so glad that you are better that I must run
and tell father directly.”</p>

<p>She left the room, and Mrs. Grimsby sat down
on the side of the bed.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said she, “I cannot tell you how
lonely we have been since your folks moved
from our house. Juliana cries every day about it,
and I never felt so sorry for anything in my life,
for now I suppose since you have got into such a
nice place, and have such fine friends to care for
you, that you will forget all about us.”</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Grimsby!” said Hesper, “wasn’t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
a friend to me in my greatest need? and didn’t
you do for me what no one else could? No: I
never shall forget you as long as I live”&mdash;and
with her slender white fingers, she affectionately
clasped the great toil-hardened hand which rested
on the bed beside her, Mrs. Grimsby raised her
checked apron and wiped away the tears which
were flowing freely down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“There!” she said, as she started up with an
effort to be cheerful, and drew her shawl around
her, “I won’t be a child! but really, Hesper, I
care more about such little things than any one
would suppose.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t let that thought trouble you any
longer” said Hesper, “but send Juliana and the
boys to see me, and kiss little Tommy for me, for
I shall always love you, and shall come to see
you as soon as I am able.”</p>

<p>“That is all I ask,” said Mrs. Grimsby. “Good
bye, darling. Be very careful of yourself”&mdash;and
she left the room with a light step and smiling
countenance.</p>

<p>Although Hesper was very much better, the
doctor would scarce allow any one to enter the
room for several days. Her mother stole in now
and then, and Hesper was astonished to see how,
fast she had improved under the doctor’s good,
management, though she was still very weak and
feeble. The poor girl thought she would like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
see her father, and yet she dared not ask to, for
he always appeared so cold and distant, and had
so often spoken unkindly to her, that she had a
secret dread of meeting him.</p>

<p>One evening, however, when she felt much
brighter than usual, and was sitting up in bed,
supported by her pillows, her mother came and
told her that if she felt able, her father would like
to speak with her. Hesper assented, and her
heart beat violently, when, in a few moments after,
she heard the sound of his approaching footsteps.
With a half frightened look, she glanced up at his
face as he bent over her. There were tears in his
eyes, and his voice trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p>“God bless you, my precious child!” he said&mdash;“I
cannot tell you how impatiently I have been
waiting to see you, for I never knew how dear you
were until I feared you would be taken from me.”
He raised her gently in his arms, and drawing her
close to his bosom, kissed her again and again.
Hesper felt that the cup of her happiness was
full. How pleasant it was to be resting in her
father’s arms, while his tears mingled with her own.
It seemed as if the prayer which she had so often
repeated&mdash;“Let thy kingdom come”&mdash;was now
fully answered, for the peace and joy of heaven
was in her heart, and all her father’s past unkindness
was forgotten.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” he said, “I have prayed night and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
day that God would spare you; for often, when
I have observed your faith and patience, I have
longed that you should love me as you did others,
and I want to show how much I can love you in
return.” Hesper’s pale cheek was pressed close to
his&mdash;</p>

<p>“Father, I always have loved you,” she said,
“but I never could say so till now.”</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it, my dear child,” he replied.
He laid her gently upon her pillow again, and
taking a seat beside her, he talked to her a long
time about little Johnny&mdash;the letters they had
received from Mose&mdash;their new home, with the
fine large garden in the rear, which they would
all take so much pleasure in cultivating when the
spring opened, and many other things, to which
Hesper listened with the deepest interest; and
when he left her, she felt so tranquil and happy,
that she sank into a pleasant sleep, which seemed
to do her more good than all the medicine she
had taken.</p>

<p>After this, she improved so rapidly that she was
soon able to talk with all who visited her, and she
was astonished to find how many kind friends she
had. Among others, George and Benny Grimsby
made their appearance, with their clothes neatly
brushed, and their faces as clean and bright as soap
and water could make them. At first the boys
were very awkward, and scarce knew what to say,
but Hesper soon touched an answering chord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, George,” said she, “I had a letter from
Mose to-day, and he wrote that I must tell you, he
had bought a real Guinea monkey.”</p>

<p>George opened wide both mouth and eyes, as he
gazed at her in breathless attention, and Benny
immediately drew his thumb from his mouth,
where it had been, ever since he entered.</p>

<p>“He says, too,” continued Hesper, “that he
means to teach him a great many comical tricks
before he comes home, and then, if you have
been good boys, you shall have him for your own.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we have been?” exclaimed
George&mdash;“we did all we could to help your father
when he moved, and we have been up here
every day since you were sick to see how you
were, and mother says she doesn’t know what she
should do without us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hesper, “I don’t know of any better
boys in town, and I will tell Mose so when he
comes home.”</p>

<p>The boys looked very much gratified, and they
continued talking about their expected present
with great animation, until aunt Betsey came in,
who looked so sharply at them, that they thought
it was time to be going. They lingered at the
door however, and in a whisper begged of Hesper
a parting kiss. With many a side-long glance at
aunt Betsey, they received the favor, which was
readily granted, and departed perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fie!” said aunt Betsey, as she took off her
moccasins and shook the snow from them against
the grate&mdash;“I wouldn’t have such great lubberly
boys kiss me; besides, I don’t think it will do you
any good, listening to their noisy talk.”</p>

<p>“O,” said Hesper, “it is a real pleasure, now
that I am so much better.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said aunt Betsey, “I am glad if you
are, though I am sure, the night I watched with
you, I hadn’t the least idea you would live till
morning. I didn’t watch with you but one night,
Hesper, for I was obliged to hurry so fast on my
bed-quilt, that I could attend to nothing else.”</p>

<p>“Is it done yet?” asked Hesper.</p>

<p>“Done!” repeated aunt Betsey, as she closed
her eyes, and leaning back in her chair, rocked
nervously to and fro&mdash;“yes; don’t you know
about it?”</p>

<p>“No;” said Hesper. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, after working night and day, I finished
it just in time for the great Exhibition. But,
don’t you think! Mrs. Larkin sent in one which
was considered a great deal the handsomest, and
won the highest prize, while mine was hardly
noticed. It was made of pieces only half as large
as mine, put together in all sorts of fanciful figures.
I said, when I looked at it, that it was a sin
and a shame for people to waste so much time upon
things which were of so little use. Mrs. Larkin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
had much better been making garments for the
poor, or improving her mind by useful reading.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” said Hesper, in a sympathizing
tone, for she knew that aunt Betsey must be greatly
disappointed.</p>

<p>“So it is,” she replied, “for after all the time
I have spent upon that bed-quilt, it is just
good for nothing. I can’t bear the sight of it;
and, Hesper, if you should ever live to be married,
I will give it to you for a wedding present.”</p>

<p>Hesper thanked her for her good intentions, but
she thought to herself that it was not at all likely
she should ever marry, and if she did, she should
not want a satin bed-quilt.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">A PLEASANT SURPRISE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> winter months passed swiftly away with the
Greyson family, in their new home, but it was not
till the spring opened, and the pleasant sunshine
and warm air came again, with their invigorating
influences, that Hesper was able to regain any of
her former strength and buoyancy of spirits.
When the weather was mild, and the sky clear,
she would steal out and work for a short time in
the little flower garden, but the good doctor still
kept his eye on her, and would not suffer her to
engage in any fatiguing employment. It happened,
fortunately, that there was no need of it, for Hesper’s
mother was now so much better, that she
could attend to the household duties, and Mr.
Greyson, who was constantly employed, earned
enough to support them all, comfortably. The
doctor had made some extensive purchases in the
way of new lands, and what with ploughing and
planting, draining meadows and clearing wood-lands,
he not only managed to keep Mr. Greyson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
but also Fred and Charlie busy. The services of
the Grimsby boys too were often required, and
though, as might have been expected, a crooked
word or a hard look would often pass between
them and the young Greysons, yet the promise
which they had made to Mose, and the presence of
Mr. Byers among them, prevented them from
breaking out into open hostilities.</p>

<p>One clear, bright summer day, Mr. Greyson and
the boys were at work in a beautiful pine grove&mdash;a
part of the doctor’s woodland, clearing away the
under-brush for the accommodation of a pic-nic,
which was to be held there the following week.
“Hurrah! hurrah!” shouted Fred all at once,
“there comes mother and Hesper.”</p>

<p>Mr. Greyson looked up, at Fred’s exclamation,
and throwing down his hatchet, he took off his
hat and waved it to them as they came down the
green and shady road that led to the grove.</p>

<p>“I am right glad to see you,” he said, “though
I am afraid it is ‘most too long a walk for two such
invalids.”</p>

<p>“O, I have enjoyed every step of the way,”
said Hesper, whose cheeks were as richly colored
as the wild rose she held in her hand.</p>

<p>“I should think mother would be tired, though,
for see, she has brought dinner enough for us all
in her basket. We mean to have a little pic-nic of
our own, so, while you and the boys are at work,
we will spread our table by the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I am right glad you thought of that,” said
Mr. Greyson, “for I am both tired and hungry,
and I shall relish my dinner much better for eating
it in pleasant company.” He took the basket
to the spring, and then left them to prepare their
table. It was a most delightful spot they had
chosen, for the grass was soft and green beneath
their feet, while up above, the branches of the
trees, interwoven with vines, screened them from
the rays of the noon-day sun. Then, too, there
was a pleasant humming of bees among the
fragrant blossoms of the locusts, to which the
musical ripple of the spring formed a sweet accord.</p>

<p>Fred and Charlie found it quite impossible to
wait until they were called, and the cloth was
scarcely spread, before they perched themselves
upon the large stones they had provided for seats.
It was not long, however, before everything was
ready, and Mr. Greyson was summoned.</p>

<p>“I declare,” said he, as he threw himself upon
the ground and wiped the perspiration from his
brow&mdash;“I would not exchange this spot for the
palace of a king, and if Mose was only here, I
could desire nothing more.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hesper, with a sad smile, “and
little Johnny too.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is,” replied her mother, “though
our poor eyes are not permitted to see his sweet
little countenance.” Fred looked up at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
thoughtfully, for a moment; then he started up,
and rolled his stone a little one side.</p>

<p>“Here, Charlie,” he said, “let him have a place
between us, for I like to think he is here.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there room for one more?” said a pleasant
voice, close beside them. They all looked up,
and saw Juliana’s face peeping out upon them
from the bushes.</p>

<p>“Yes, and welcome,” said Hesper. “But pray
how came you here?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Juliana, “mother stayed at home
to-day, so I thought I would just run over and see
you. When I came to the house I found no one
there, but on my way back I met with Kate Smiley,
who told me where you were. I thought, on the
whole, I would venture to join your party, for I
shall not have so good a chance to be with you
again, as I open a school next week. Mother says
she can’t earn money enough to supply all my
need, so I must see what I can do for myself.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Hesper, with a smiling countenance,
“am going to school next week. Father
has promised me that I shall go all summer.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Greyson, “Hesper shall have
all she needs, if I work my fingers to the bone,
and she shall enjoy her school to her heart’s content,
for I mean to make up, if possible, for her
working so hard last winter.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” sighed Juliana, as she glanced down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
at her old dress&mdash;“how much I wish that I could
go too. But I can’t,” she continued, “so there’s no
use fretting about it.”</p>

<p>They were still very much engaged in conversation,
and had almost finished their dinner, when
they heard the sound of a carriage coming along
the road. They looked out from among the trees
and saw Capt. Clark with a stranger in his wagon.
They wondered who he could be, for they had
scarce ever seen a more rough looking personage.
His hair and beard were both long and bushy&mdash;over
his shoulders he carried a stick with a bundle
on it, and his clothes looked travel worn and
dusty. The Captain stopped his horse just as
they arrived at the spring.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” said he, “if here isn’t a gipsey
party! Come, friend, let’s join them a few moments.”
They both sprang from the wagon, and
approached the little group.</p>

<p>“You see, here,” said the Captain, addressing
Mr. Greyson and pointing towards the stranger&mdash;“a
poor traveller, whom I overtook on my way
from the city. The cars had started before him,
and he was so anxious to reach home that he set
out on foot.” Before he could finish speaking, the
stranger threw down his stick and bundle, and
clasping Juliana around the neck, he kissed her
with all his might. The poor girl screamed with
surprise, but the next moment she cried out&mdash;“father!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
father!” and returned his salutation
with a good will.</p>

<p>Sure enough it was their old friend and neighbor,
Mr. Grimsby, though his rude dress had so
disguised him that it was difficult to recognize
him.</p>

<p>“How is this?” said Mr. Greyson, as he shook
hands with him&mdash;“we were not looking for you
back so soon.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he replied, “I have had famous luck&mdash;better
than I could have possibly expected! and as
I didn’t want my wife going out a washing, or my
children wandering about the streets, while I was
so well able to take care of them, I have come
home to make them comfortable and happy.”</p>

<p>Juliana was so delighted that she laughed and
cried, and scarce knew what to do, in order to
express her joy.</p>

<p>“There, now,” said Hesper, “you will let her
go to school with me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her father, “she shall live like a
lady, dress like a queen, and be educated like a
professor, if she wants to, for I am able to do it,
and mean that there shall be one Grimsby, at
least, who shall make a show in the world. So
come along my girl, let’s go to your mother and
the boys, and see if they like my looks as well as
you do.”</p>

<p>Capt. Clark helped her into his wagon, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Mrs. Greyson and Hesper, who were right glad
of this opportunity to ride home. Away they all
started, with happy hearts and smiling countenances,
while Mr. Greyson and the boys, who
remained behind, sent three parting cheers after
them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">MR. BYERS ON MATRIMONY.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Hesper</span> had at length completed her seventeenth
year, but her early discipline of sorrow and toil
had given her a judgment and experience far beyond
that age. During the time that she attended
school, a friendship had sprung up between her
and Alice Smiley, the doctor’s youngest daughter.
They were often together, and nothing could delight
these girls more, than to secure Mr. Byers’
company in some of their walks, for his sage
remarks and peculiar mode of expression, was to
them a never failing fund of interest and amusement.
At times, when a convenient opportunity
offered, they would all drop into aunt Nyna’s, and
sup with her from her little round table, which
always seemed so comfortable and cozy. Bread
and butter never tasted so good anywhere else,
and tea, taken from those little China cups, so thin
and small that they seemed almost like egg-shells,
was perfectly delicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>One night, the good lady had a larger party than
usual, for she had previously sent out her invitations,
comprehending both Juliana, and Kate, the
doctor’s eldest daughter. Aunt Nyna was in fine
spirits that day, on account of having received a
letter from Harry, and with it quite a sum of
money, which he desired her to use according as
her pleasure or necessity demanded. After tea,
when they had all sat down together, the good
lady, in the fulness of her heart, besought the
pleasure of reading the letter to the company, to
which they readily assented. In it, there was, as
usual, a message to his “little wife,” assuring her,
that if he continued to succeed as well as he had
of late, he should come home soon, and claim her
as his bride in reality. The young people laughed
when they observed that Hesper blushed deeply,
and Mr. Byers immediately offered her a large
palm-leaf fan.</p>

<p>“Thee shouldn’t notice it when ladies blush,
friend Byers,” said aunt Nyna, as she laid down
the letter and regarded Hesper with a pleasant
smile. “Once the good child only laughed at such
things, but now she blushes, and is silent. Canst
thee tell me what makes the difference, Hesper?”</p>

<p>“O,” replied Hesper, still blushing and smiling,
“it is because I am older, and because&mdash;because
I don’t know why.”</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly,” said Mr. Byers. “I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
entirely satisfied with your explanation, it is so perfectly
natural.”</p>

<p>“But,” continued Hesper, recovering her self-possession,
“I don’t see how Harry ever came to
call me his ‘little wife,’ or why he still persists
in doing so, now that we are both so old.”</p>

<p>“Then let me tell thee,” said aunt Nyna, with
an expression of great interest. “I can well
remember the first time he ever saw thee. He
was five years of age, and thou only five days when
I took him with me to see the new baby. I never
saw a little fellow so delighted with anything in
my life. He kissed the baby’s soft round cheeks,
so tenderly&mdash;looked with wonder and admiration
at the little tiny hands, and then prayed us to let
him take her in his arms, just one moment. Finally,
he asked the baby’s name. The father&mdash;he
was well and cheerful then&mdash;told him it was
Hesper. The little fellow shook his curly head
thoughtfully, as he said&mdash;’I don’t like it&mdash;I
would much rather have her named sissy, or little
Miss Muffit,’ of whom he had learned in his nursery
rhymes.</p>

<p>“We all laughed; at which the poor child
seemed greatly disconcerted. ‘Look here, Harry,’
said thy father, and he took him kindly on his
knee. ‘When my little baby first came to me, it
was evening&mdash;the sun had gone down behind the
hills, and the great clouds which were sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
through the sky, were of many beautiful colors.
As I stood at the window, thanking God that he
had given me such a precious little daughter, I
looked up, and there I saw a beautiful bright star,
in the midst of the clouds, shining calmly down
upon me. It was the evening star, and years ago
the people called it Hesper. It was so very bright
and beautiful, that the same thankful, prayerful
feeling came over me, that I had when I first
looked upon the face of my new-born child. Then
I said I will call my little daughter Hesper, for
she came to me in the evening, when the night
shadows were falling upon the earth, and it may
be, as the years pass on, she will become like yonder
star, a light to the pathway of many, so we
shall bless God that he ever sent her into this
world. That is the reason, Harry, why I called
her Hesper.’ The little fellow sat in silence, a few
moments; then he looked up with his face all
aglow with pleasant thoughts. ‘I like it now,’ he
said, ‘for the stars are the moon’s babies, and if
she came down from God, it is right to call her
Hesper, for she, too, is a little star baby.’ It was
a simple, child-like thought, but it pleased us
much, and for months after, thy mother called
thee her ‘star-baby.’ When it was time to go, I
could not make the little fellow willing to part
from thee. He stole timidly up to thy mother’s
bed-room and looked her long and earnestly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
face. ‘Please ma’am,’ he said, at length, in his
coaxing, child-like way, ‘won’t you give me your
baby?’ Thy mother laid her pale hand gently
among his curls, and said&mdash;’My dear child, I
would not part with my precious baby for all the
wealth of the world.’ The little fellow was
disappointed. His lips quivered, and his eyes filled
with tears. ‘Never mind, Master Harry,’ said thy
father, by way of consolation. ‘Wait till you are
older, and better able to take care of her, and
then you shall have her for your little wife, if you
will.’ He seemed well contented with this promise,
and went away quite willingly. In after years,
thy father disapproved of it, when Harry called
thee by that name, but thy father himself was
first at fault, for the child never forgot the promise,
but has called thee his little wife, from that
day to this.”</p>

<p>“And in all probability, he will call her so to
the day of his death,” said Mr. Byers, “only in a
higher and more truthful sense.”</p>

<p>“No, no;” said Hesper, seriously, “I never
shall marry. I said so when I was a child, and I
say so now.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” said Mr. Byers, with seeming impatience,
“who ever heard such nonsense! A good
looking, useful, affectionate girl, making a resolution
at seventeen, to be an old maid to all eternity!
Why, you deserve the censure of all sober-minded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
rational people. If I were only a young man of
twenty, the first thing I would do, would be to
offer myself to you, and I don’t know,” he added,
“but what, even now&mdash;” Here he hesitated,
and looked over towards Hesper, with that indescribable
twinkle of sly humor in his eyes which
was perfectly irresistible. The whole company
burst into a hearty laugh, and Hesper, falling in
with the old man’s merry mood, signified her
willingness at once to receive a formal proposal.</p>

<p>“Attention, girls!” said Mr. Byers, after the
laugh had subsided&mdash;and putting on a more
serious countenance, he assumed at once a lecturing
attitude. “I have somewhat to say to you on this
subject of matrimony. It is now more than sixty
years that I have looked the world in the face, and
I feel, by this time, that I have a right to say that
I know something about it. From sixteen till
twenty-one I sowed my wild oats like any young
fellow. At twenty-five I married, and began life
in real earnest. I was a poor man, and had to
earn my bread by the sweat of my brow. As time
passed on, and the little ones began to gather
around my table, I thanked God and worked all
the harder. But fortune often made wry faces at
me, and sometimes cast me headlong into the
slough of despond. I didn’t stay there long, however,
for the thought of Hannah and the children
set me on my feet again, and called up energies I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
never knew were mine. When Mary, the eldest,
was sixteen, she went into a decline, and fading
slowly like a spring violet, at length she died. It
was a heart breaking thing to us, but before we
had fairly recovered from it, Willie, our second
child, was upset in a pleasure boat, and drowned.
Scarcely a year after, our blue-eyed Charlie died
of a fever. Then I cannot tell you how entirely
we placed our affections upon sweet little Fanny,
our last remaining one, nor how hopelessly we
mourned, when we found that the hand of the
Destroyer was upon her also. O, girls! Heaven
grant that you may never know such hours of
watching and anxiety as we experienced, when,
one night in mid-winter, the dear child lay upon
her pillow, suffering beneath the croup, that
scourge of childhood. I never shall forget how
piteously she moaned, stretching up her trembling
hands to us, and praying us for relief. Our utmost
exertions were in vain, and at length, after hours
of suffering, the little creature sobbed and moaned
her soul away into the hand of her Creator.” The
old man was silent for a few moments, and then
continued.</p>

<p>“It was too much for my poor Hannah, for the
saddest, loneliest thing in this wide world, is the
heart of a childless mother&mdash;one who has watched
faithfully and tenderly over her little flock, and
followed them one after another to the grave. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
may carry a quiet face before the world, but inwardly
the broken chords are still bleeding, and
the busy fingers of memory, with frequent touches,
keep the wound ever open. Thus it was with
Hannah. She tried to be cheerful, but the blow
was too heavy, and at length she sank beneath it.
Twenty years she walked by my side, and shared
the cup of my joy and sorrow. That score of
years was full of toil, and care, and trouble. If I
had never married, I might have escaped that experience.
But no: I thank God for it! With all
its shadows, the memory therof is pleasant, and I
am twice the man that I should be without it.
Girls! you will never know what real life is, till
you have learned to love with all the heart and
soul&mdash;- to live no longer for yourselves, but for
others, never mind what the consequences may
be.”</p>

<p>Kate Smiley looked up timidly, and in her own,
gentle, unaffected manner, repeated these lines of
Tennyson’s&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn8 p1">“I hold it true whate’er befall,&mdash;<br />
I feel it when I sorrow most;<br />
‘Tis better to have loved and lost,<br />
Than never to have loved at all.”</p>

<p class="p1">“That’s it, exactly!” exclaimed Mr. Byers;
“God, knew when he placed us in this world, what
was best for us, and all these sad experiences
which spring from our hearts’ best affections, work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
out a wonderful weight of good at last. The ‘wise
man’ says, ‘with all thy getting, get understanding;’
and I say to you girls, with all your getting,
get husbands.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Kate Smiley, who had already refused
several offers, “you certainly wouldn’t have
a woman take up with anybody, for the sake of
getting married, and may be if she refuses two or
three offers, because they do not seem suitable,
that she will have to be an old maid at last, in
spite of herself?”</p>

<p>“No, girls, no!” said Mr. Byers with much
emphasis, “don’t throw yourselves away, under
any circumstances, but wait till Mr. Right comes
along, if ‘tis half a century, and if he never comes,
then die happy in the thought that you did the
best you could.”</p>

<p>“But, supposing,” said Juliana, with a mischievous
look, “that I, for instance, should think
I had married Mr. Right, and in the course of a
few years he should prove to be Mr. Wrong&mdash;perhaps
take to drinking and other bad habits&mdash;abuse
me shamefully&mdash;threaten my life, and
make me in all things as miserable as possible.”</p>

<p>“O, that’s an extreme case,” said Mr. Byers.</p>

<p>“But then you know such things happen.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll tell you what to do,” said the
old gentleman, very decidedly&mdash;“rake up the
fire, turn the cat out of doors, tie up the baby in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the table cloth, and taking it on your back, start
for parts unknown immediately.”</p>

<p>They all laughed, but Hesper shook her head.</p>

<p>“No:” she said, “that would be utter selfishness.
I should say stand by him till the last moment.
Love, suffer, beseech and entreat, and if all availed
nothing, then die for him, or with him, but never
forsake him.” Mr. Byers regarded her seriously
and affectionately.</p>

<p>“O Hesper! Star of Peace and never failing
Charity,” he said, “where will thy long-suffering
end! God grant thou mayest never be brought
to the trial!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE THANKSGIVING DINNER.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">“Isn’t</span> it almost time for Mose to come home?”
said George Grimsby, one day, as he came into
the kitchen, where Hesper was at work.</p>

<p>“Almost,” she replied. “Capt. Clark says that
we can expect him in the course of a week or two,
though I shall try not to think of it too soon, for
the ship may have a long passage, and then I
should be very much disappointed.”</p>

<p>“What a pity it is,” remarked George, “that
he can’t be here next Thursday! We shan’t have
half so good a time without him.”</p>

<p>The day to which he alluded, was the annual
Thanksgiving, and the Grimsby family, with uncle
Nathan and aunt Betsey, Capt. Clark and his
mother, with aunt Nyna and Mr. Byers, had been
invited to take dinner with the Greysons. The
children had talked of nothing else for the last
fortnight, and Hesper herself had looked forward
to it with much pleasure, though she knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
thoughts of the loved and absent would cast a
shadow over her joy. She was, however, surrounded
by so many comforts and blessings, and
the future looked so bright before her, that she
could not repine one moment. With a light step
and a smiling countenance, she went about the
house doing all she could to provide for the comfort
and convenience of her expected guests. Her
cheeks grew rosy red with exercise, and as she
sung little snatches of songs while about her work,
her voice sounded so sweet and pleasant, that her
mother, who was sewing in the next room, laid
down her work to listen. Every sly corner and
piece of furniture was visited with the broom and
duster&mdash;the tin ware and the great pewter platters
on the kitchen shelves, shone like new silver,
and not a spot could be seen upon the floor, she
had scoured it so faithfully.</p>

<p>She was so much fatigued upon the night previous
to the eventful day, that when she went to
her chamber, she fell asleep as soon as she touched
her pillow, and did not awake till the morning
sun was shining brightly into her window.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she exclaimed, as she sprang from
her bed, “how came I to oversleep myself thus,
upon this morning of all others!”</p>

<p>She dressed herself quickly, and ran down stairs
in great haste, expecting that her father would be
quite vexed with her, for being so late; but to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
surprise she found the table spread, and the breakfast
nearly ready, though her mother had not yet
risen. Her father had been up some time, and he
had attended to these things as faithfully as she
would herself.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” said Hesper, as she warmed her
hands by the blazing fire, “I little thought of
sleeping so late.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you did,” said her father, “for you
needed the rest, and I always like to do anything
about the house, when I have the opportunity.”</p>

<p>Hesper could not help thinking how differently
he appeared from what he did a year ago, and just
then, it seemed to her as though no one was ever
blessed with half so good a father. As he bent
down to turn over the great back-log, which sent
whole showers of sparks up the chimney, she imprinted
a warm kiss upon his cheek.</p>

<p>“Thank you, darling;” he said, “that is the
sweetest reward I can have for my labors.”</p>

<p>Fred and Charlie could scarce wait for breakfast
to be over, before they prayed Hesper to let
them have their new jackets, which, with the rows
of bright brass buttons, seemed to them more
beautiful than anything they had ever seen. They
had informed the Grimsby boys of their new possessions
in rather a boastful manner, but were somewhat
humbled when George told them, in return,
that he and Benny had whole new suits. At Hesper’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
suggestion, however, they concluded to defer
the matter till they had brought some wood to
kindle a fire in the parlor, which was soon done.</p>

<p>During the night there had been a light fall of
snow, and now the ground looked even and white
as far as one could see, but the sun was shining
brightly in the clear blue sky, and whole flocks of
little snow larks were flying from tree to tree, or
leaving their tiny foot-prints in the snow as they
hopped about in search of food.</p>

<p>As Hesper stood by the window and looked out,
a carriage drove up to the door, and Mr. Grimsby,
with his wife, and little Tommy, and Juliana, and
the boys, sprang out, all dressed in their best, and
looking never so happy. Hesper had scarce time
to welcome them, before uncle Nathan and aunt
Betsey arrived. Next came Mrs. Clark with aunt
Nyna and Mr. Byers. Mrs. Clark told Hesper that
she did not know as the Captain would come&mdash;“for,”
said she, “he received word yesterday, that
he must come to the city immediately, on important
business. He said he should be back this
morning, if possible, but that you must by no
means wait for him.”</p>

<p>They did wait however, for Mr. Greyson was
very anxious that all should be there, and it was
with great reluctance that at last they took their
seats without him. A mammoth turkey&mdash;the
gift of Capt. Clark, lay like a fallen hero upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
dish in the centre of the table. His sides, so
nicely brown, were swollen almost to bursting
with the savory dressing within, and the rich
juices were oozing from every pore. This was no
ordinary sight to any of these good people, and the
boys looked on with breathless interest, as Mr.
Greyson commenced the operation of carving.
George Grimsby carefully regarded each piece as it
fell, and indulged in a thousand secret longings
for the portion which contained the coveted wish-bone,
for he had the greatest faith in its power to
bring about desirable results. To his unspeakable
joy, it actually did fall to his share. As quickly
as possible he disengaged it from its surroundings,
and polished it without delay.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said to Fred, who was his right
hand neighbor&mdash;“let’s wish together.”</p>

<p>Not liking to attract the attention of the company,
the boys held the bone below the table, and
pulled with all their might. It did not part easily,
but the boys were resolute, and at last it separated.</p>

<p>“There,” exclaimed George triumphantly, as he
held up his part&mdash;“I have my wish, and now I
will tell you what it is&mdash;I wish Mose would come
home to-day.”</p>

<p>“That is right!” said Hesper. “So do I.”
And “so do I” was repeated all around the table.</p>

<p>“There comes Capt. Clark,” said aunt Nyna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
who sat nearest the window. She put down
her knife and fork as she spoke&mdash;’rose half way
from her seat, then sat down again and glanced
smilingly at the company. The next moment the
door opened and Capt. Clark entered, with a young
man&mdash;rather tall, with black whiskers, and his
complexion somewhat darkened by exposure to the
weather.</p>

<p>“How do you do, good people?” said the Captain,
very politely. “Allow me to introduce to
you&mdash;“</p>

<p>“Mose! Mose!” exclaimed Hesper, as she overturned
her chair in her haste, and sprang into his
arms.</p>

<p>All arose from the table at once to receive him.
Tears, and kisses, and smiles, were mingled together,
for a more heartfelt greeting was never
known.</p>

<p>“How are you, my boy?” said Mr. Greyson,
with joyful earnestness, as he grasped his hand.</p>

<p>Mose looked at his father in astonishment, as
he replied. Instead of the sullen, despairing look,
which he had worn for years, his countenance was
now radiant with hope and happiness. He spoke,
he looked, and acted, like a man who had confidence
in God and himself, and was both able and
willing to do his duty in the world, whatever it
might be. Then, too, Mose looked at his mother&mdash;so
sick and feeble when he left home that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
feared he never should see her again&mdash;but now
she stood there with tears of joy in her mild eyes,
and the glow of health upon her cheek. He had
saved every cent of his earnings, that he might
come home and minister to their wants, as far as
possible, but all around him he saw signs of comfort
and prosperity, for which he was wholly
unprepared. They had purposely kept their removal
to the new home a secret, and now they
fully enjoyed his surprise.</p>

<p>“How has this all happened?” he asked&mdash;“What
good spirit has aided you?”</p>

<p>“Here, Mose,” replied his father, as he laid his
hand on Hesper’s shoulder&mdash;“is our fairy. She
labored without fainting when our burdens were
the heaviest. Her faith and patience were both
example and rebuke to me in my despondency.
Her never failing love and goodness has warmed
my heart into action, and her truth and simplicity
opened the way whereby others stretched out their
hands to help us. God bless her! No better angel
than she has ever crossed our threshold.”</p>

<p>The poor girl blushed painfully at this unlooked
for praise, from the usually silent lips of her father,
and she was in no small degree relieved, when the
attention of the company was turned from her by
George Grimsby, who stole up behind Mose, and
pulling him by the coat, asked in a loud whisper
concerning the whereabouts of his Guinea monkey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Upon being assured that the desired object might
be expected by the regular packet, early next
morning, he returned to his seat with a smiling
countenance.</p>

<p>Again Mose looked round upon the little group,
and then, turning to his mother, he said in a faltering
tone&mdash;“all here but one!” His loving
heart missed the welcome which would have come
from the little one who was now slumbering in the
dust. That sweet, childish face, with the clustering
ringlets and soft blue eyes, was pictured distinctly
in his memory, and as the thought came
home to him that he would behold it upon earth
no more, he bowed his head upon his hands and
wept. Hesper sobbed aloud, for the wound was
yet fresh in her heart, and then, for a few moments,
there was a hushed and reverent silence
throughout the room.</p>

<p>“Come, children,” said Mr. Greyson, at length,
as he motioned for Mose and Hesper to take their
seats at the table, “let us think no longer of the
grave, but of the bright heaven beyond, where the
child of our love sits down with the angels to a
feast of Thanksgiving, far more joyful than any
that earth can know.” At these words the whole
company resumed their seats, and soon the passing
shadow had vanished from their countenances.</p>

<p>“Hast thee brought me no message from my
boy Harry?” said aunt Nyna at length, who for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
some time had maintained a considerate silence, but
now ventured to speak.</p>

<p>“Aye, that I have,” said Mose, thrusting his
hand into his coat pocket. “Here is a letter and a
daguerreotype”&mdash;and he passed them over at
once to the good lady.</p>

<p>With eager hands she opened the miniature,
while Hesper peeped over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why!” she exclaimed, with a look of astonishment,
“how he has altered!” and Hesper, as
she gazed at it in wonder, thought so likewise. Instead
of the merry, frank looking companion of
her childhood, here was an individual, apparently
much older, of a very intellectual cast of countenance,
with large, thoughtful eyes, and a high,
white forehead, from which the dark hair was
turned back, displaying to great advantage its
breadth and fulness.</p>

<p>Mose started up and glanced at it. “O!” he
said, “I have made a mistake! That is Mr.
Clyde, who came home as passenger in our ship.
He is a fine fellow, though rather singular. We
became very good friends on the home passage,
and at parting he gave me his miniature. He is
stopping in the city now, and says that if I remain
at home till spring, which I think is likely, he may
possibly look in upon me some day.”</p>

<p>So saying, Mose drew another daguerreotype
from his pocket, and exchanged with aunt Nyna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s him!” she exclaimed, joyfully&mdash;“only
looking more like a man and ten times handsomer.”</p>

<p>The color deepened upon Hesper’s cheeks, and
her eye brightened, as she gazed at it; for in the
frank, manly countenance before her, she recognized
at once the companion of her childhood.
There was the same richly clustering hair, above
his open brow&mdash;the eyes beaming pleasantly upon
her as of old, and the same cheerful smile lingering
about the mouth, which had never spoken any
other words to her than those of kindness and love.
Her heart beat quickly, and fearing that the rest
of the company might observe her emotion, she
resumed her seat. Through the whole of the day,
in the midst of all the sport and enjoyment, memory
still kept the countenance of her early companion
before her, and when she retired to rest
that night, it still looked out upon her through all
the wandering fancies of her dreams.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pch">A NEW PHASE OF FEELING.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning after the arrival of Mose, as
Hesper was at work in her chamber, there came a
light tap at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said, and Mose entered.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” he said, as he took a seat by her
side, “there was one thing that I did not have an
opportunity to speak to you about last night, so I
thought I would come to you this morning. When
I was in Canton with Harry, we often sat down
together, and talked about home folks. The poor
fellow’s heart yearned sadly after his friends, and
if he didn’t think it would seem altogether too
unmanly to leave such good business as he is in at
present, I don’t believe he would stay there
another day. He often mentioned you, for he
said that of all his playmates, there was not one
who seemed nearer or dearer to him than you;
and then, Hesper, you must forgive me, but I
couldn’t help telling him what a patient, true-hearted
sister you were: How thoughtful, industrious,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Fie, Mose!” said Hesper, blushing deeply&mdash;“He
must have thought you wanted to recommend
me.”</p>

<p>“Not by any means! for it was altogether unnecessary,
as he thought full enough of you
already. I let him read all your letters.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mose! I wouldn’t have thought it! I
only wrote them for you, and they weren’t fit for
any one else to see.”</p>

<p>“Harry thought they were, though, for he read
them again and again, and then he asked me if I
supposed you would be willing to write such letters
to him. He said he was often very lonely so
far away from home, and sometimes discouraged,
but if he could be expecting such pleasant little
messengers from you, it would put new life into
his heart and strength into his hands, and he
could be more content to remain there, so long as
duty or necessity demanded. I told him I had no
doubt you would be willing, for you were always
glad to do anything that would make another
happy. More than that, Hesper, I will say, that
although Harry is one of the kindest, best hearted
fellows in the world, yet he isn’t what he should
be. I love him as I do an own brother, but then I
saw that he was easily led into temptation, and liked
a good time a little too well. Now this would be
precisely the reason why some people would advise
you not to write him, but I don’t think so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“No, no;” said Hesper. “It’s love, not hatred,
that calls back the erring, and I should be
the last one to turn away from Harry in such a
case.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t a bad fellow by any means,” said
Mose&mdash;“only inclined to be wild and thoughtless.
You can have more influence with him than any
one, Hesper, and therefore I say write to him by
all means, for there is no knowing what dangers
your kind and encouraging words may save him
from.”</p>

<p>“I will, most certainly,” replied Hesper, earnestly&mdash;“But,
then,” she added with some hesitation,
“I don’t know how to begin. I would much
rather he should write to me first.”</p>

<p>“Which he has done,” said Mose, as he drew a
small package from his pocket and tossed it into
her lap. “He gave me that, the day I left, and
as he put it into my hand, he said&mdash;’Mose speak
a good word for me to your sweet sister, for
though I am sometimes wrong in head, yet I’m
true at heart, and shall remain so, if Hesper will
consent to be my guiding star.”</p>

<p>There was a somewhat nervous movement to
Hesper’s fingers as she attempted to untie the
string. As the knot did not yield readily, she
clipped it at once with her scissors&mdash;tore off the
wrapper in haste, and there was a letter and
another likeness of Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now,” said Mose, as he rose from his seat, “I
will leave you to your own reflections, but let me
suggest, that if you answer that letter, you must
do so soon, for the next mail starts in the course
of a few days.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had Mose left the room, when Hesper
commenced reading her letter, and we shall consider
it no betrayal of confidence, if we give an
exact copy.</p>

<p class="pn1 reduct">“<span class="smcap">My Dear Little Wife</span>:</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p>For so I must ever call you. It seems very
awkward, at first, to think of writing to you, but I
feel that I must, for my heart is very full, and I wish
to awaken an answering spirit in return. The sight
of your brother Mose, and the long conversations
we have had together about home, has made me almost
wish to be a boy again, and to wander hand in
hand with you over my native hills once more. It is
nearly three years now since we parted, and time
must have made some important changes in us both,
but I hope it has not touched the blessed affection of
our childhood. You are in your eighteenth year
now, and I in my twenty-third, therefore we cannot
think of each other precisely as we did. I am no
longer the wild, careless boy, who ran races with
Bose along the seashore, or climbed the hickory
trees to shake down the ripened nuts for you.
Neither are you now, the little round faced girl
whom I so often dragged to school on my sled, or
carried over the brook in my arms, when it was so
swollen as to overflow the stepping-stones. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
loved each other very much then&mdash;as much as if
we were brother and sister, but I do not want you
to think of me as a brother now. The morning I
parted from you on the wharf, you threw your arms
about my neck, kissing me again and again, as the
tears streamed down your rosy cheeks. I said to
you&mdash;be my good “little wife” till I come back,
and then you shall be my wife in reality. You only
answered, as you clasped your arms still more closely&mdash;’O
Harry! Harry! How much I shall miss
you!’</p>

<p>After the boat reached the ship, I took the glass,
and looking out, I saw that same little girl standing
upon the cap-log of the wharf, with her hands shading
her eyes, and gazing earnestly towards the ship.
Bless her dear good heart! I said to myself, there is
not one who thinks more of me than she, and I was
glad to know that I should be remembered by one
so faithful and true. I have seen some hard experience
since then&mdash;have fallen into various temptations
and done many wrong things, for I grew careless
and forgetful. But when Mose came, and I read
your letters, so tender, so thoughtful and kind, I
longed to be good again, and to have you write such
letters to me, only do not write as if I were your
brother. O no: Hesper. We are what may be
called a young man and woman now, therefore I
would have you love me with a different love, which
shall grow broader and deeper as time rolls on, and
at length unite our hearts as one forever. Hesper,
if you will be my guiding star, I shall learn to love
all that is high, and noble, and worthy. I shall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
something certain to love and labor for, and something
to remind me of God and holy things in this
heathenish land. Perhaps you think that you are
yet too young to turn your mind to such things;
but no, Hesper, you are plenty old enough to know
whether you can love your old companion more than
as a brother; old enough too to think of the new
relations and responsibilities which life may bring,
and to prepare for them gradually. You can do me
much good if you will, Hesper, for there is nothing
awakens a young man’s better feelings more effectually,
however wayward he may be, than to know
that a true hearted, pure minded woman loves him,
prays for him, and is willing to trust her happiness
to him.</p>

<p>In two years more I shall be home again&mdash;’Home
again!’ How those words make my heart throb
and dim my eyes as I write them! Then, as I clasp
your hand in mine, and look upon your well remembered
face once more, may it not be with the thought
that I am never to be parted from you again? O
Hesper! do not take away this great and pleasant
hope from me, but write to me words of strength
and encouragement, and both God and my own heart
shall bless you. Write to me soon, for I shall wait
most anxiously to hear from you.</p>
</div>

<p class="pr8 reduct">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct"><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">Hesper read this letter with a throbbing heart
and tearful eyes, and when she had finished it, she
laid her face upon the table and wept freely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why!” she said at length, as she brushed
away her tears, “there was nothing in that letter
to make me weep! How foolish I am!” With an
effort at self-control she arose and walked the floor
a few moments, then, observing the miniature, she
took it and looked at it long and thoughtfully.
Her face gradually assumed a serene and beautiful
expression, and at length, seemingly unconscious
of what she did, she pressed the likeness to her
lips.</p>

<p>“What is that, Hesper?” said her mother, who
had entered unheard, and stood close behind her.</p>

<p>Hesper turned and blushed, but the next moment
she threw her arms around her mother’s
neck, and laid her head on her bosom.</p>

<p>“O mother!” she said, “I am glad you have
come, for I am almost bewildered, and need you
to think for me. There is one who is trying to
steal your daughter’s heart from you, and perhaps
you have come in just the right time to prevent
it.”</p>

<p>“That, I am sure I shall not do,” replied her
mother, “if it only goes in the right direction, for
I have seen enough of my daughter’s heart, to
know that it can contain all her affection for me,
and a much greater love beside.”</p>

<p>Hesper placed a chair for her mother, and then
read the letter aloud. There was a troubled expression
to Mrs. Greyson’s face, but she did not
allow her daughter to perceive it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now, what shall I do, mother?” said
Hesper, as she concluded.</p>

<p>“Let your own heart answer, dear child.”</p>

<p>“But its words are very uncertain. Advise me,
dear mother! advise me!” she added, entreatingly.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said her mother, as she placed her
hand beneath her daughter’s chin, and looked her
steadily in the eyes, “Do you think you love
Harry more than as a brother.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I think I could if I tried,” stammered Hesper,
with a very honest look.</p>

<p>“You do love him,” said her mother, “and
therefore I say&mdash;use your love and influence as
far as possible for his good, and trust God for the
result. I cannot help dreading for you, my dear
child, the experience which such association and
relationship bring, but it is all for the best; for
you would always be a child in heart and mind
without it. Go on and take your woman’s lot as
it comes, for there is a good God above, who
ordereth all things well.”</p>

<p>“Mother! mother!” said Hesper, in a faltering
tone, as she crept close to the bosom of her sympathising
parent, “I am afraid of life and what lies
before me, and wish I could die now. I cannot
bear to think of going away from you and father,
to live with one who may be unkind and neglectful
towards me. I will write to Harry and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
him that I love him very much, but I fear that I
can never marry him.”</p>

<p>“That is childish,” said her mother, “and you
will know that it is, when you have had a wider
experience. No, my dear child; take the cup of
life just as God mingles it, thanking Him not only
for the sweet but also for the bitter. Joy and sorrow
is the common lot of all below, and those who
drink most willing of the draught as it comes, are
best prepared for a higher and holier life above.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE STRANGER GUEST.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> happened very fortunately that Mose could
stay at home all winter, for Mr. Greyson’s health
began to fail him, so that he could not work as
formerly, and therefore every cent that Mose
earned, went to support the family. Hesper also
took in plain sewing, which, with the time she devoted
to the education of her younger brothers,
kept her always busy. The interchange of letters
between her and Harry, was as frequent as time
and distance would allow, and so grateful did the
poor fellow seem for her kindness, so tender and
delicate in his expressions of affection, and so
hopeful for the future, that the thought of him
became to her a continual inspiration and joy.
His name was mingled in her prayers, and she
thanked God most sincerely for this new and
beautiful phase in her experience.</p>

<p>The spring of that year was very mild and early,
and as soon as possible, the whole Greyson family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
commenced gardening operations. Hesper reserved
the front yard for herself, and soon converted
it into a most flourishing flower-garden.
Her tulips and daffodils, hyacinths and pansies,
were the admiration of the whole village, and
especially of aunt Betsey, who helped herself from
them freely.</p>

<p>One evening, about sunset, as she was very busy
among the flowers, she was startled by the sound
of a footstep, and turning, she beheld a strange
gentleman, very tall and pale, just entering the
front gate. He slightly raised his hat, and bowed
coldly, as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good evening, Miss. Is Moses Greyson&mdash;your
brother, I suppose&mdash;at home?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Hesper, “he went down to
the village about half an hour since, but said he
should be back soon. Will you please step in and
wait for him?”</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” said the stranger, “I prefer
walking till he returns, and perhaps I may
meet him.”</p>

<p>He raised his hat, with another stiff bow, and
then turned away. Hesper looked after him with
curiosity and surprise. His face, though so very
pale, was handsome, on account of the regular
features, large dark eyes and high forehead, but
then the expression of his countenance was of a
marble coldness, and his whole manner stiff and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
formal. She felt quite certain that she had seen
his face before, but where, she could not tell.
She perplexed herself a long time over this dim
memory, when suddenly it occurred to her that
this person must be Mr. Clyde, the friend of Mose,
whose likeness he had given to aunt Nyna by mistake,
on the day of his return.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said Hesper to herself, with a half
shudder, “I don’t see what Mose can fancy in
him, for I am sure I don’t like him at all.”</p>

<p>It was about dark when Mose returned, and
then he came alone.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said he, “I have seen my friend, Mr.
Clyde. He is stopping at the hotel down in the
village, and after a deal of persuasion, he has at
length consented to take his baggage and come
here, so I thought I would run home and tell you
that you might prepare for him.”</p>

<p>“O dear!” said Hesper, with a look of dismay,
“I’m almost sorry, for he is so cold and formal,
that I never shall be able to get acquainted with
him.”</p>

<p>“Well”&mdash;replied Mose, with some hesitation,
“I suppose, to tell the truth, that the less notice
you take of him, the better. He was always very
peculiar, but he is more so now, for this reason.
When he came home, about six months ago, he
was engaged to a very beautiful and accomplished
lady, whom he was to marry soon after his arrival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
But you can judge of his feelings, when he found
that only a few weeks previous she had married
another, and the only excuse she made, was, that
she loved this one better, and therefore felt it was
right for her to marry him.”</p>

<p>“How heartless!” exclaimed Hesper.</p>

<p>“Well, in consequence of this,” resumed Mose,
“Mr. Clyde has become bitter against the whole
sex. He believes they are all false hearted and
designing, and does not wish to have any dealings
with them. I think he will feel differently about
this, however, when time has taken away the sting
of his disappointment; but at present he is in a
very unhappy frame of mind, and I think is almost
sick.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” said Hesper, in a sympathizing
tone. “I am glad you have invited him here. I
will do all I can to make him comfortable, and at
the same time will be very careful not to trouble
him in any way. What a sad thing it must be to
have one’s brightest and best hopes in life disappointed.”
She thought of Harry, and inwardly rejoiced
that no such dark shadow lay between them.</p>

<p>With all possible haste she made ready the best
chamber, for the expected guest, and placed a
small bouquet of her choicest flowers upon the
stand. An hour afterwards, Mr. Clyde entered
with Mose, and retired directly to his chamber.
Hesper saw nothing of him that night, but when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
at a late hour, she sought her own quiet pillow,
she lay awake and listened a long time to the
measured footsteps of the unhappy man who
paced the floor in the chamber beyond. Her
heart sorrowed deeply for him, and she besought
the great Father earnestly, that a blessing of peace
might fall upon “the stranger within their gates.”</p>

<p>Very early the next morning&mdash;just as the first
peep of daylight began to crimson the eastern sky,
Mose stepped quietly into Hesper’s chamber, and
awakened her.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” he said, “Mr. Clyde is really quite
sick. Just now, when I awoke, I heard him
moan as if in pain, and I hurried at once into his
room. I found him yet dressed, lying upon the
outside of the bed, as though he had only thrown
himself down for a short nap. He breathed quick
and heavily&mdash;his face and hands were burning
with fever, and he talked constantly in his sleep.
I managed with a great deal of difficulty to arouse
him, and gave him some water. I asked him if
he felt sick, it was some time before he understood
me, and then he said&mdash;’Yes, Mose, sick in every
bone of my body. I have tried to throw off
these terrible feelings, for the last three weeks, but
now they have fairly got possession of me. Let
them come though, I say, for the sooner I die the
better.’”</p>

<p>“Then he dropped into the same troubled sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
again, and I left him. Now I want you to get up
and dress you, while I run over to Dr. Smiley’s,
for I think this matter should be attended to directly.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Hesper, whose sympathies
were at once awakened. “Poor fellow, how
I do pity him.”</p>

<p>Mose left her, and she arose and dressed herself
immediately. As she listened, she too could
hear the quick, heavy breathing, in the room beyond,
and the broken sentences he uttered in his
sleep. It was not long before Mose and the doctor
arrived. Upon going up to see the sick man, the
doctor ordered him to be put to bed at once, and
to be kept there. He said that he was evidently
threatened with a fever, but by proper care and
attention, it might be broken up at once. His
whole nervous system appeared to be very much
disordered, and therefore he must of necessity be
sick for a time, before he could recover&mdash;that the
best way for him was to lie still and take it as
quietly as possible, and in the end, it might prove
a benefit to him. He gave him very little medicine&mdash;put
him on low, simple diet, and advised
Mose to sit with him through the day, as his mind
seemed to wander greatly.</p>

<p>It was no small tax upon the time and attention
of the brother and sister, to have the care of a
sick person added to their other responsibilities,
but instead of murmuring, they rejoiced that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
were able to meet this new demand upon their
sympathies, and spared no exertions to make the
sufferer comfortable. Mose remained with him
through the whole of three days and nights, during
which time the sick man only sat up long
enough to have his bed made, which Hesper did
as quickly and quietly as possible. She put the
whole room in order in a very few moments&mdash;brought
him his breakfast of nicely prepared
gruel or some other light food, and then, like
a good fairy, vanished till she was needed
again. She never spoke one word to him or Mose
while she was in the room, and scarcely glanced
towards the sick man, who usually sat pale and
motionless in his high backed chair, seemingly
unmindful of all things. But he was not so, by
any means, for he watched Hesper closely, as she
stole so quietly about his room, and finally slipped
out like a frightened bird.</p>

<p>Upon the fourth morning he was so much better,
that after his bed was made, he proposed taking
his pillow and lying down upon the sofa which
was very comfortable. With the doctor’s consent
Hesper had raised one window a little way, and
thrown open the blinds to let in the sunshine and
warm air. This seemed to refresh the invalid at
once, and of his own accord he mentioned how
very beautiful and fragrant the running roses and
jessamines were, which peeped in at the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>This encouraged Hesper, and upon the strength
of it, she gathered a small bouquet, and placed it
on his table. He glanced at it as she did so, and
said in a pleasant tone&mdash;</p>

<p>“I see you are quite fond of flowers, Miss Hesper.”</p>

<p>“Yes sir,” she replied with a startled look, for
these were the first words he had addressed to her
since he entered the house&mdash;“I like them very
well, though I do not make much talk about
them.”</p>

<p>“That is just as it should be,” said Mr. Clyde.
“People care very little for things which they are
continually talking about. When a woman pretends
to be in love, one can easily judge by her
nonsensical prattle, as to the quality of her affections,
though it takes some time to find it out.”</p>

<p>As he said this, there was the same expression
to his countenance, which Hesper disliked so much,
she felt uncomfortable, and hastened to get out of
the room, but just as she was crossing the
threshold, he called her back.</p>

<p>“Miss Hesper,” he said, “your brother informs
me that he cannot be with me to-day; allow me
therefore to ask the favor of a book, to wile away
my time with.”</p>

<p>“I have only one that I think will interest
you,” said Hesper, thoughtfully&mdash;“and that is
‘Brothers and Sisters,’ by Miss Bremer. Did you
ever read it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“No,” he replied. “Please bring it, for I don’t
care what it is, if it will only take up my mind.”
She brought the book directly, for which he thanked
her very courteously, and placed himself in a
position to read. About half an hour afterwards,
however, when she went in to give him his medicine,
she found him lying there with the volume
closed, in his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t you find the book interesting?” she
asked, timidly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, “but my head is weak, and
my eyes get tired so soon, that I find an attempt
to read is useless.”</p>

<p>Hesper turned quickly, as though she would
speak, but she checked herself, and again proceeded
towards the door. He had observed her movement
however, and called after her.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” he said, “what was you about to
remark?”</p>

<p>“Only sir,” she replied very meekly, “that if
you wished, I would gladly read to you, as I am
at leisure at present. But then I feared you
would think me too officious.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he replied. “I should be very
grateful, if you would read to me a while, for my
mind is full of troublesome thoughts to-day.
Only,” he added, as the unpleasant expression
came again over his countenance&mdash;“sit where I
cannot see you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>Hesper took her chair and placed it a little way
from the end of the sofa, where his head lay, so
that he could not observe her. When she first
commenced reading, her voice trembled a little,
but she soon gained confidence, and as she became
interested in the story, she quite forgot who she
was reading to. She read on, chapter after chapter,
for a long time, till suddenly Mr. Clyde interrupted
her.</p>

<p>“Stop, my kind friend,” he said; “I had quite
forgotten, while listening so intently, that you
were mortal, and subject to weariness. I will
trespass no farther upon your good will, at present,
but must beg of you to favor me in a like
manner, another time. Your kindness has been
of great benefit to me, and I thank you, most sincerely.”</p>

<p>Hesper’s face brightened with a pleasant smile
of satisfaction. “I am very glad,” she said, “if I
have been of the least service, and shall be happy
to read to you again, whenever you wish.”</p>

<p>That very afternoon Mr. Clyde intimated to her,
that if it would not be asking too much, he should
be glad to hear a little more of the story. The
next day he made the same request, and the next
also, though now he was so much better that he
was able to walk about the room, and even to go
down into the yard among the flowers, which he
greatly admired. He pleaded weariness, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
when he desired her to read, and so she continued
till the book was finished. Towards the last, as
they became better acquainted, he would sit beside
her while she read, and no longer desired her to
keep out of his sight.</p>

<p>At one such time, aunt Betsey happened in, and
she regarded them with indignation and surprise.
Her call was very short, and upon leaving she proceeded
directly to aunt Nyna’s, in a state of great
excitement, and informed her of what she had
seen. She said she thought such things were
scandalous, and ought to be attended to immediately,
more especially as report said that Hesper
was already engaged to Harry. She wondered, too,
what Hesper’s mother could be thinking of, to
allow such doings right before her eyes.</p>

<p>“But then,” she added, “Susan always was a
strange woman, and always would be to the end
of time,” therefore she advised aunt Nyna to go
down that very night, and give Hesper “a real
talking to.”</p>

<p>To her great disappointment, however, the good
lady replied, that she didn’t see any harm in such
things, and that she thought Hesper did perfectly
right. She added still more to aunt Betsey’s vexation,
by calling in Fred Greyson, who was at work
in her garden, and sending him to ask Mose and
Hesper, with Mr. Clyde, to tea, which invitation
was very promptly accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of three weeks, as Mr. Clyde’s health
seemed to be fully re-established, he began to talk
of leaving, to which proposition both Mose and
Hesper listened with regret, for although he was
often silent and reserved, yet there were hours
when all his better nature shone forth, and then
he seemed to Hesper a man whom any one might
respect and admire. The day of his departure
was not set, but he was awaiting the answer to a
letter which would determine it. He proposed
starting immediately for Europe, where he intended
travelling for a few years, to restore his wasted
energies, both of mind and body.</p>

<p>“But,” he added seriously, as they were conversing
together concerning his plans&mdash;“I have
met with so many crosses and disappointments in
life, that I cannot expect much for the future. At
best, the remainder of my days will be but a staying,
and not a cheerful, actual existence.”</p>

<p>Shortly after this conversation Mr. Clyde went
out with Mose, and left Hesper at her sewing. She
became at length very weary with her monotonous
toil; so she took her gipsey hat and strolled away
into the woods beyond the old Rolling Mill. After
wandering about among the hills and hollows for
some time, gathering ferns and wild flowers, she
struck at length into the deeply shaded path which
led by the side of the brook. She continued
musingly on her way, till she came to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
rock where she had talked with Mose, just before
he went to sea. Here she seated herself, and gathering
up the violets and tender green leaves which
grew profusely about her, commenced forming
them into a wreath. She became very much interested
in her employment, but just as she was
giving the finishing touches to her work, she heard
the sound of footsteps, and looking along the green
pathway, she beheld Mr. Clyde coming towards
her. He did not smile when he saw her, and she
thought he looked paler and more serious than
ever.</p>

<p>“Ah, Hesper!” he said, “I am glad that I have
found you at last, for I have received a letter, saying
that I must be in the city to-night, therefore, in the
course of an hour or so, I shall be on my way.”</p>

<p>“O, I am so sorry!” said Hesper, with the instinctive
utterance of an innocent heart. She let
the violet wreath fall upon her lap, and gazed up
at him as he leaned silently against a tree. The
changing light and shadow which came through
the green leaved boughs, played fitfully over his
countenance. He held his hat in his hand, and
had brushed back the masses of dark hair from
his high pale brow. His eyes were turned from
her, yet she could see in them a look of unutterable
sorrow, and around his mouth a quivering
expression of anguish, as though he felt obliged to
compress his lips firmly, to keep back a rush of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
contending emotions. She could not behold that
expression unmoved. Her kindly heart beat in
sympathy, and her eyes filled with tears. He
turned and looked at her one moment, and then
threw himself upon the grass beside her.</p>

<p>“Hesper, my sweet sister,” he said, “I cannot
leave you without telling you how much I have to
thank you for&mdash;more than you can realize in
yourself&mdash;nay, nay, do not shrink from me like a
frightened dove. I am not quite an ice-berg,
though oftentimes my cold exterior would make
you think so. Circumstances have made me what
I am, and given me this mask of formality, which
I wear before the world, where curious eyes are
ever ready to prey upon a bleeding heart, but before
the never failing charity of your pure soul, I
dare appear as I am. Not only must I thank you
for your kindly services during my sickness, but
also for saving me from an utter disbelief in woman’s
truth and goodness, for when a man loses
his faith in woman, the brightest star in the
heaven of his existence is quenched. Had you
intruded in the least upon my feelings&mdash;had you
by word, or look, or sign, overstepped the boundary
which my jealous soul had placed for you, I
should have hated you. But no: it was not thus,
for ever gentle, helpful and retiring, you manifested
your sympathy for my stricken heart in the
simplest, most unobtrusive way, and always conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
towards me with that cheerful, pure-hearted
simplicity, which is the greatest charm of the true
woman. From this and from what I have learned
of your past history, you have shown me, that
however much I may have been disappointed, yet
my cherished ideal of woman is not altogether
false, and so I go forth to the world again, with the
faint hope in my heart, that somewhere on the
face of the earth, I may find that ideal, and make
it the altar for my yearning affections.”</p>

<p>The tears streamed down Hesper’s cheeks as he
spoke. “O, Mr. Clyde!” she said earnestly,
“believe me, although there is so much of deception
in the worlds that you will find many, many
women much better than my own poor self. There
are many pure and faithful hearts filled with a
never failing fountain of affection, scattered up
and down in the world, but you will find that they
scarce ever beat beneath silken garments and
glancing jewels. Look for true love rather among
those who serve humbly and suffer long, for the
heart grows tender and truthful under the discipline
of sorrow. I have not lived long in the
world, but I have seen enough of it to know that.”</p>

<p>“You are right, good angel,” said Mr. Clyde,
as he regarded her with an earnest, sorrowful look.
“What I could not learn through years of varied
experience, has come to you through your own intuitions,
and now your speak it to my shame. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
know myself, now, after the first feeling of bitterness
has passed, that heretofore I have worshipped
false deities, and laid my soul’s best offerings upon
shrines wholly unworthy of them, but while the
arrow of disappointment still rankles in my heart
that thought can give me little consolation. Time
alone can heal the wound, and teach me that indifference
which shall turn my heart to stone.”</p>

<p>“O no! no!” said Hesper, quickly, as she laid
her hand upon his shoulder, and looked him earnestly
in the face&mdash;“not to stone, for is there not
much in the world to live for and enjoy, even
though one particular affection cannot be gratified?”</p>

<p>Mr. Clyde shook his head seriously. “Put the
question to your own heart,” he said. “An earnest,
joyful love for the companion of your childhood,
gladdens and inspires your whole being.
You are sitting in the sunshine of a great hope,
and your whole future is radiant with the golden
hues which your own soul casts before you. Tell
me, should these hopes be disappointed, should
this light go out in darkness, would you turn unmoved
to the world, and find much there, even
then, to make you happy? If so, then you have
not the tender, sympathizing nature, which I had
ascribed to you.”</p>

<p>For the first time did it cross Hesper’s mind,
that such a shadow might fall upon her pathway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and her deep sympathy for her friend made her
feel how terrible it would be. She laid her hand
for an instant upon her heart, while an expression
of pain crossed her countenance. Then the cloud
passed, and the calm sweet look returned again.</p>

<p>“I know,” she said frankly, “that I should not
be indifferent. I know it would almost crush me
to the earth, but I trust it would only be for
a while, and when I arose again, my soul would be
stronger and better for the trial. Mr. Clyde, the
only sure refuge from any such sorrow, is to forget
one’s self entirely, and live only for the sake
of others. That is what I think I should do, and
it would be my only chance of safety.”</p>

<p>For one moment Mr. Clyde held her clasped
hands in his own, and looked searchingly into her
face.</p>

<p>“I know, you good, true soul,” he said, “that
you would do thus, for it is precisely the turn
which such natures as yours would take, but it
would be a hard task for me.”</p>

<p>“It is always easier to advise than to do,” replied
Hesper, “and especially in such cases&mdash;but
Mr. Clyde,” she added, with great earnestness, “I
believe you have a nature equal to any such thing,
and that the reason of your disappointment, is because
God has something better in reserve for you,
than a union with a vain, false-hearted woman.”</p>

<p>Her words seemed to have a powerful effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
upon him, for he closed his eyes and compressed
his lips firmly, while that same quivering expression
of anguish which she had so often observed,
played around them. It was but for a moment
however, and then he started up suddenly.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” he said, “I must not tarry longer,
for time flies rapidly. Let me bid you farewell
here. I may never see you again, and therefore
when I think of you, I want to picture you in my
memory as you sit here, like a wood-nymph, with
this back ground of moss-covered hills, and the
spring violets blooming at your feet.”</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon her head, and gently
smoothed away the tresses of soft, brown hair.
“God grant,” he continued, “that the blight of
wasted affection may never fall upon you, for of all
the trials that rend the human heart, there are none
which wound it so deeply as those which come
through the avenues of the affections.” As he
spoke, he bowed his head and imprinted a light
kiss upon her forehead. A tear-drop fell upon her
cheek, and she knew that his manly heart must
be stirred with deep emotions, or it would never
manifest itself thus. She glanced up at him timidly.
He clasped her hand warmly in his own for
a moment, then he suddenly dropped it&mdash;took
the little violet wreath from her lap, and without
casting one backward glance, hastened along the
green pathway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Hesper was bewildered by her feelings. She
could not understand herself, and yielding to her
motions, she laid her face upon the mossy hill-side
and wept like a child. She did not know
before, how much she cared for Mr. Clyde, but
now it seemed as though one, dear as a brother,
was taken from her. Musing deeply upon “life’s
mysterious destinies,” she wandered slowly along
the wood-path, and then, not wishing to meet him
again, she took her way across the hills to the cottage
of aunt Nyna.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CHARITY SCHOOL.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">As</span> we have already stated, Mr. Byers was very
fond of children, and in return, the children were
greatly attached to him. In his walks over the
hills and along the seashore, he was never without
companions, first and foremost among whom,
ranked the Greysons and Grimsbys. As the years
passed on, his followers increased so rapidly in
stature and wisdom, that the old man often contemplated
them in silent astonishment, more particularly
little Tommy, who, from a tender yearling,
had progressed to a stout little fellow of
some three or four years, and scorning longer to
be a mere portable, used his powers of locomotion
to great advantage.</p>

<p>As Mr. Byers was deeply impressed with a sense
of his own moral responsibility, he endeavored at
all times to instruct as well as amuse the children.
He discoursed to them very learnedly upon the
nature and habits of shell-fish&mdash;directed their
young minds to the untiring industry of the wild-bees,
and at one time occupied their attention a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
full half hour, with a lecture upon the rise and
progress of mushrooms, which was occasioned by
finding a mammoth specimen in a swampy
hollow.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the appearance of Mr. Byers
at nightfall, was a matter of no slight interest to
the young people of the village, and he was seldom
seen, at that time, without a large group of children
about him, of all sizes and colors. The good
old man received all, and rejected none, although
there were several among his followers who were
highly objectionable. Prominent among these was
a big boy of fifteen, familiarly known among the
children as “black Jake.” To the little ones, his
very personal appearance rendered him an object
of terror, but the older children had far more
forcible reasons for their aversion to him. He had
several times been in the House of Correction,
and would have been there oftener, had he not
managed to escape the vigilance of the law. He
smoked and swore as freely as a much older person,
and was always ready for any sort of desperate
undertaking. There seemed, however, to be
more of mischief than malice in his composition,
for although he was constantly playing tricks
upon his companions, yet he was very careful not
to do them any personal injury, and if he robbed
them of anything in sport, he was ready to restore
fourfold the next moment. Only when his temper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
was fairly aroused, was black Jake perfectly
formidable, and then he was a very lion. Few
grown people dared oppose his wrath at such
times, for he was entirely reckless as to what he
did. For several weeks he had attended the village
school, but after creating a general rebellion, and
whipping the master, he turned his back with contempt
upon the halls of learning, and took to the
more congenial employment of hunting and fishing.
In some unaccountable way he had become
the possessor of a gun, and it was his constant
companion night and day. He was continually
prowling about the woods in search of game, and
oftentimes the school girls, upon their berrying
excursions, had been frightened half out of their
wits by the sudden discharge of Jake’s fowling
piece close to their ears, or equally alarmed by his
springing from the bushes directly among them
when they least thought him near.</p>

<p>At one time, a benevolent minister in the village
had taken him under his especial protection, in
the hopes of reforming and regenerating him; but
he finally dismissed him in despair, declaring
openly that he believed the boy was “totally depraved.”
After this fall from favor, Jake’s last
estate was worse than his first, and he was left by
friends and foes to work out his own destiny.</p>

<p>Of course, therefore, it was with no slight regret
that Mr. Byers beheld Jake among his little company,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
but he said nothing, for there were several
others of the same stamp, and he could by no
means reject them. His heart was drawn out
with the tenderest sympathy towards the little
group that surrounded him, and, to use the
language of Scripture&mdash;“he had compassion on
them, because they were as sheep without a shepherd.”
Night and day he was continually revolving
in his mind some benevolent purpose concerning
them, and finally, a suggestion presented itself,
which he readily accepted. Without delay he
hastened to Hesper and laid his plan before her.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, as he came into the
kitchen and found her alone, “I have an excellent
project in view, but I want you to help me;&mdash;the
fact is, I can’t do anything without your
assistance. I will tell you what it is: As I was
walking with the children to-night, I thought all
at once that you, and I, and a few others, could
open an evening charity school, so that all these
poor children who couldn’t or wouldn’t go to
school in the daytime, could have an opportunity
to learn which otherwise they would not. Now
what do you think of it? Isn’t it an excellent
idea? Come, say yes, directly,” said the old man,
with great animation.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” replied Hesper, thoughtfully,
“but, then, we shall want a hall and lights, and
books and stationery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“O, never mind that!” said Mr. Byers&mdash;“that’s
just nothing as a hinderance. We can easily get
all we want somehow.”</p>

<p>“But how?” said Hesper.</p>

<p>“O, now don’t be discouraging,” said the old
man entreatingly, “for I have really set my heart
upon this matter. If you will only just take right
hold, and stir round, and talk to one and another,
it will come all right, I haven’t a doubt.”</p>

<p>Hesper smiled, and made no farther objection;
but this was exactly the way with Mr. Byers. He
was excellent at planning, but never good at execution,
therefore nearly all his benevolent projects
fell through before they could be carried into
effect. Hesper felt very much interested, however,
in his present plan, and determined that it
should not fail for want of effort upon her part.</p>

<p>The very next day she set herself about the
work. The first one she applied to was Dr. Smiley,
who approved highly of the movement, and offered
her the use of his large hall in the village, free of
expense. She next went to Capt. Clark, who
agreed to furnish the school with lights, and then
she started a subscription paper to obtain money
for the books and stationery. This was a great
deal for her to do, but the good result which was
like to be accomplished, inspired her, and she
pressed forward without hesitation.</p>

<p>When aunt Betsey heard of this movement, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
said she thought Hesper was making herself publicly
ridiculous, and at the first convenient opportunity,
she asked her what she expected to get for
instructing such a set of “poor, miserable, rag-a-muffins.”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Hesper, “except the satisfaction
of doing a good deed.”</p>

<p>Aunt Betsey dropped her work and regarded her
with a look of silent astonishment.</p>

<p>“Hesper Greyson,” she said at length, “I believe
you are half crazy, and you needn’t be angry
with me for saying it, but I can’t help thinking
that you only do this to make yourself popular;
just like some of those missionary women and
tract distributors, who are continually running
about from house to house and doing anything but
minding their own business. But, however, every
one to their liking. If you choose to make a fool
of yourself you may, but as to buying books for
those miserable creatures to double into dog’s ears
and daub with their dirty fingers, I tell you I won’t
give the first copper towards it.”</p>

<p>“O,” said Hesper, with a look of smiling satisfaction,
“there’s no need of it, for people have been
very liberal, and we have already sufficient funds
to commence with. Even poor Mrs. Wilkins gave
me two dollars without hesitation, and said she
felt it a privilege to do so.”</p>

<p>“Debby Wilkins!” exclaimed aunt Betsey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with a look of contempt. “Well now, I do declare!
She had much better have kept her money and
bought herself a new bonnet, for I must say, that
her old one is a disgrace to any Christian woman,
more especially one who attends church so regularly.
Two dollars! Well I suppose she thought
you would tell of it, and she wasn’t mistaken
either. Dear me! what won’t some people do for
the sake of popularity?”&mdash;and aunt Betsey resumed
her sewing again with great diligence.</p>

<p>The school at length was fully commenced, and
there was a much larger attendance than had
been expected. Not only did the children come,
but also many of their parents, and teachers were
in great demand. Even Fred and Charlie Greyson,
with the Grimsby boys, were of great assistance
in this respect, for they could, at least, teach the
alphabet, although it often happened that some of
their pupils were much older than themselves. It
was no unusual thing to see little Charlie standing
by the side of a good natured old colored lady&mdash;who
wore both cap and spectacles&mdash;and as he
slowly pointed out the letters with his little ruddy
finger, she repeated them after him with great
care. The school was not only composed of pupils
of every age, size and color, but also of many
nations, but everything went on harmoniously,
and their improvement was rapid.</p>

<p>There was one, however, who notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
various invitations, stood aloof from this arrangement,
and resisted all efforts to draw him into it.
This one was black Jake, and Mr. Byers at length
concluded that as he would be more trouble than
he was worth, it was best to give him up. Hesper
was more hopeful however, and longed for an
opportunity to speak with him, which she found it
very difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>One day, however, as she was crossing the brook
between her own home and aunt Nyna’s, she spied
Jake on the bank, skinning a rabbit which he had
killed a short time previous. His gun and a bunch
of dead birds lay on the ground beside him.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Jake!” said Hesper, as she stopped
suddenly&mdash;“what a nice parcel of birds you
have! Did you kill them all this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, every one;” said Jake, briefly, as he continued
his operations.</p>

<p>“And what a fine fat rabbit, too! Why, I
declare, you are quite a sportsman!”</p>

<p>Jake looked up with a smile&mdash;“Yes,” said he,
“this is a nice little fellow, and will make a first
rate dinner for me. Won’t you please, Miss Hesper,
to just hold him by the legs, while I pull
the skin off over his back? There, that’s it.
Thank you.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jake!” said Hesper, as she let go of
the little creature with a secret shudder&mdash;“you
did that in a real scientific manner. I don’t believe
I could possibly have done it myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Jake, with a gratified look, “there
is everything in knowing how.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Hesper, “we all have to live and
learn, and there are none of us so wise but what
we can learn many things of one another. But
that makes me think, Jake&mdash;why don’t you come
to our evening school? We should be glad to
have you.”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t want to,” he replied decidedly,
“and what’s more, I won’t. I haven’t been
to school since I licked the master, and if I should
go again, it wouldn’t be three weeks before I
should do the same, and that would be the end
on’t.”</p>

<p>“But, Jake,” said Hesper, pleasantly&mdash;“I
should be your teacher, and you wouldn’t lick me,
would you?”</p>

<p>The rude boy looked up to her face with a broad
grin.</p>

<p>“Lick you!” he repeated, while his countenance
assumed an expression as though the idea
was perfectly preposterous; “I would sooner cut
off my right hand first&mdash;and what’s more, if I
saw any fellow lift his finger against you, or even
make an ugly face at you, I’d skin him as quick
as I did this rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Then Jake,” said Hesper, “you are just the
one I want, for sometimes I have a great deal of
trouble, and I need a good friend to stand by me
so you’ll come to-night, won’t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about it,” said Jake, with some
hesitation&mdash;“When I get among the white boys
they call me a nigger, and that makes me so mad
I could kill ‘em with a good will.”</p>

<p>“Jake,” said Hesper, as she laid her hand on
his shoulder and looked him earnestly in the face,
“if you’ll be my friend, I’ll be yours, and whoever
treats you unkindly, it shall be all the same as if
it were me. The Good Father, up there in heaven,
cares nothing for the color of the skin. It is the
heart alone he looks at, and therefore I shall do
the same. We should all love one another in this
world like brothers and sisters, Jake, so don’t turn
away from me when I want to do you good, but I
pray you, try my friendship a little while, and if
it does not satisfy you then seek something
better.”</p>

<p>Jake dropped his rabbit upon the ground, and
looked up to her with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Miss Hesper,” he said earnestly, “I believe
you are a good angel, for nobody ever spoke so to
me before. If you’ll only be kind to me and love
me all the time as you do now, I’ll go to school or
anywhere, and do just as you want me.”</p>

<p>There was a convincing earnestness in his manner,
and Hesper felt that she had touched the
right chord in a nature which had long been misunderstood.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Jake!” she said, as she clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
his hand with heartfelt sincerity. “Let me see
you then at the hall to-night, and I will do all I
can to make you happy.”</p>

<p>With a light heart and smiling countenance she
turned to pursue her way again, but had not proceeded
far, when Jake came running after her.</p>

<p>“Miss Hesper,” said he, “wouldn’t you like to
have these birds for your dinner? they are all
quails and wood-pigeons, and you will find them
nice eating.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like to rob you, Jake,” said Hesper,
as she looked at the birds, which she really did
not want.</p>

<p>“O please do take them!” he said entreatingly.
“I’ll dress them all nicely, and wash them in the
brook, and carry them up to your house myself, if
you only say so.”</p>

<p>“Well, Jake,” replied Hesper, without further
hesitation, “I shall be greatly obliged to you if
you will, and I will cook them as nicely as possible.”</p>

<p>Away flew Jake again to the brook, perfectly
delighted, and Hesper continued on her way.</p>

<p>There was no small commotion in the school
that evening, when black Jake made his appearance
among them. He regarded the whole
assembly with a look of defiance, but the moment
he drew near Hesper, he seemed to soften and
bend immediately beneath the glance of her gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
eye. For the first few evenings he did very
well, and then he grew restless and uneasy, but
Hesper watched him closely, and by her unvarying
kindness and attention, she at length succeeded in
calling up all the powers of his better nature.
Then nothing could keep him from the school, and
he made more rapid improvement than any of the
others.</p>

<p>Before many weeks, the Charity School became
a very popular thing, and visitors came pouring in
from all quarters. Among them aunt Betsey at
length made her appearance. At first she only
came just within the door, and with her spectacles
upon her nose, she surveyed the whole school
with a sharp, half-contemptuous gaze. Then she
drew her dress close about her, and passed along
to the place where Hesper was engaged in teaching.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” she said in an under tone, “what
a looking set of mortals! Black, white, grey and
all colors&mdash;old, young and middling. Why I
don’t see, Hesper, how you can stay here five minutes!
more especially with that great, dirty black
fellow close to your elbow!”</p>

<p>She spoke cautiously, but nevertheless, Jake
overheard, and he brought his clenched fist down,
with so-much force upon his slate, that he cracked
it entirely across, and attracted the attention of
the whole school.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” said aunt Betsey, as she started
back in alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Jake was about to spring from his chair, but
Hesper laid her hand firmly upon his shoulder.
She felt him trembling violently beneath her touch,
and she knew that his fiery spirit could ill brook
control, but she did not loose her hold, and kept
soothing him with gentle words, till gradually he
bowed his head upon his hands and rested them
upon the table before him. His whole frame
shook with emotion, but Hesper knew that the
poor boy had won a great moral victory, and her
heart rejoiced with him. Aunt Betsey, however,
was unconscious of all this, and therefore she regarded
him with a very angry and suspicious look.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she said, after a few moment’s silence,
“I can’t stay here another minute. I am
really afraid of taking some pestiferous disease in
this horrid atmosphere. I think your school is a
very good thing, Hesper, and I wish it all success,
but I don’t believe I shall ever come again&mdash;good
night”&mdash;and she bustled out, with an expression
of countenance, which was anything but pleasing.</p>

<p>For more than four months the school continued
in a most prosperous condition, and then, as the
evenings grew very short, and many of the scholars
were about to leave for their summer employment,
it was proposed to suspend the school until
the following September. A few evenings previous
to the breaking up, however, black Jake was missing,
and the sad intelligence was brought that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
had fallen from the third story of a house which
was in process of erection, and was now lying in a
very precarious condition. With all possible haste
Hesper repaired to his bed-side next day, and
found her worst fears confirmed. He did not
seem to suffer much pain, but the blood which
flowed slowly but constantly from his mouth,
showed that he had sustained a severe internal
injury.</p>

<p>“O Miss Hesper!” he whispered, as soon as he
beheld her loved countenance, “I knew you
would come! All night I have been comforted
with the thought that I should see you in the
morning.” The tears of grateful affection rolled
down his cheeks as he spoke, and he pressed her
hand earnestly to his heart.</p>

<p>“The doctor says I am going to die, Miss Hesper,”
he continued, “and I am willing to go, for
ever since you told me that the Good Father in
heaven cared nothing for the color of the skin, I
have longed to go to him. I thought once that
every body in the world hated me, and so I hated
every body, but when I found that you loved me
and cared for me, then I tried to be a better boy.
I only knew how to read a very little when I came
to your school, but you soon made it so easy and
pleasant for me, that very often, when I was in the
woods, instead of killing birds and rabbits, I would
lay down in the bushes and spell out the words in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the little Testament you gave me. Now I think it
is best for me to die, for if I grow up to be a man,
I may become wicked and careless again, and I
should never be ready to go. But let me tell now,
Miss Hesper, while I am able, it is your love and
kindness that makes me feel so happy, and I hope
God will bless you for it forever and ever.”</p>

<p>Poor Hesper’s loving heart was so deeply moved
by the boy’s earnestness, that she could not speak.
She could only put her handkerchief to her face
and weep like a child. It so happened that the
old minister who had formerly taken Jake under
his care, had entered unobserved, and overheard
the boy’s words. With tearful eyes he now drew
near the bed and extended his hand.</p>

<p>“My poor fellow,” he said, “I have wronged
you, but it was because I did not understand
your nature. I endeavored to drive you into
goodness, therefore you hated me, and my labor
was lost. God forgive me that I forgot ‘the
charity that never faileth’&mdash;the love that ‘overcometh
all things.’ But this good girl has taught
me a useful lesson, and henceforth I shall endeavor
to profit by it.”</p>

<p>The old man knelt by the side of the bed in
prayer, and his words came with a perfect gush of
earnestness and love. When he arose and looked
upon the boy’s face again, he perceived that the
spirit even then was preparing to lay aside its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
mortal garment. One after another the neighbors
and friends dropped in, and many of Jake’s schoolmates
gathered around his bed. He regarded
them all with a pleasant smile&mdash;turned his eyes
with a look of grateful love to Hesper’s countenance,
and then, drawing his weeping mother
closer to him, he breathed his life away like a
weary child upon her bosom.</p>

<p>A few days after this, the whole school followed
poor Jake’s mortal remains to their last resting
place, and the old minister addressed the assembly
so earnestly and touchingly at the grave, that all
were moved to tears. It seemed to Hesper a
strange dispensation of Providence, that thus
briefly the poor boy had been thrown upon her
sympathies, and then suddenly withdrawn when
his life seemed budding forth into the fulness of
promise. But she felt that a wise purpose had
been served, and full of strength and consolation
did the thought come to her, that if only in this
one instance her labors among the poor children
had been crowned with success, she was amply
rewarded. Thus she reasoned with herself, but
she could not see deeply enough into her own nature,
to comprehend, that this one simple incident
had formed a chapter in her experience, clearly
illustrating the pure principle of love which not
only governed all her actions, but was also leading
her on to still higher attainments in the
future.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">As</span> time passed on, and Mose made several successive
voyages, he was at length promoted to the
rank of first mate, and then it was whispered
among the village gossips, with some truth, that he
had found favor in the eyes of Alice Smiley, the
doctor’s youngest daughter. He was not indeed
her equal in point of social position or education,
but his frankness and manliness of character, his
general intelligence and unaffected goodness of
heart, had so far won upon her, that she could
easily overlook all minor differences. He was also
a great favorite with her father, and therefore he
would meet with no difficulty in that quarter.
Hesper was very much pleased with this arrangement,
but the village gossips were greatly surprised,
as they had already selected Juliana Grimsby for
Mose. Aunt Betsey, in particular, made herself
very busy about the matter, and came down one
evening for the express purpose of talking it over
with Hesper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here,” said she, “I think Mose is setting
himself up most too high, and if I ain’t much mistaken,
he’ll find it out before long. These people
that are always trying to get themselves in among
the aristocracy, seldom escape without punishment.
They are petted and patronized for a time,
and then pitched out all of a sudden, for some new
favorite. I know how it is, for I’ve tried it myself
afore now. If he had contented himself
among common folks, and taken up with Juliana
Grimsby, I should have approved of his choice,
and made the bride a handsome present; but
now I shan’t do the least thing in the world
for him. Juliana is a smart, likely girl, and
would have made him an excellent wife.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt of it,” said Hesper, “but then
every one has their own choice you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied aunt Betsey, “but it may
be a mighty foolish choice though, if ‘tis one’s own.
There are some people who don’t know what is
for their good half so well as others can tell them,
and so they often make grievous mistakes, which,
with a little advice, they might have avoided.
Now if Mose had only asked me, I should have
said Juliana, by all means. Just think, Hesper,
how handsome she is! why, there isn’t a girl in
the village that will compare with her!”</p>

<p>“It is true,” replied Hesper, “that Juliana is
very handsome&mdash;much more so than Alice; but
then Mose don’t think much of beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I think he does though,” returned aunt Betsey,
“but it’s of a peculiar kind. The beauty of
the doctor’s purse is far more attractive than his
daughter’s countenance.”</p>

<p>Hesper bit her lips quickly to keep from answering,
for she was greatly vexed.</p>

<p>“Now, as far as you and Harry are concerned,”
continued aunt Betsey, “I have not a word to say.
You are well matched, and I suppose, by what I
hear, that he has quite a snug little fortune laid
up, by this time. Let’s see; you are expecting
him home before long, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“I should not be surprised to hear of his
arrival at any time,” replied Hesper, quietly.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” resumed aunt Betsey, “what a
time his mother will make! She thinks so much
of her Harry. Don’t you think! the other day
she really undertook to pity me, because I had no
children! Why, it was perfectly ridiculous! for
the Searcher of Hearts knows, that I never desired
them.”</p>

<p>Just then, in rushed Bose like a mad creature&mdash;he
jumped&mdash;he howled, he barked, and then
laid down on the floor and rolled with all his
might.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” exclaimed aunt Betsey, as she
sprang upon the dining table and drew her dress
close about her&mdash;“The creature is certainly mad!
Hesper, put your head out of the window, and
scream for help as loud as you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>Hesper, however, who was not so much alarmed,
was regarding the dog with some curiosity, for
this was rather an unusual demonstration on his
part. So earnestly was her attention fixed upon
him, that she did not perceive the entrance of any
one, till a strong arm was thrown around her, and
a warm kiss imprinted upon her cheek. She
glanced up quickly, at the pleasant, manly countenance
that bent over her, and exclaimed “Harry!”
for the long expected one, had really returned.</p>

<p>“O law!” said aunt Betsey, as she descended
from the table, and shook hands with the young
man, “that accounts for the dog’s actions. Why,
what a knowing creature he is!” She didn’t
stop long, however, for she and Bose never were
friends, and never could be.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” said Harry, “I couldn’t wait to see
mother, but sent my baggage along and came directly
here. I suppose, however, the good old
lady will be almost crazy till I come, so I pray
you put on your bonnet and shawl and go with
me.”</p>

<p>Hesper made herself ready as soon as possible,
and while she was doing so, Harry lit his cigar.</p>

<p>“I hope,” said he, as they passed along, “that
this smoke isn’t disagreeable to you. Some
women have a great objection to cigar smoke, but
if you’ll just go over to the windward it won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
come so directly in your face. It’s a bad habit I
know, but then if I don’t smoke I chew, and one is
about as bad as the other. I’m sorry, but I can’t
help it.”</p>

<p>Hesper could not help feeling a little sorry too,
but then, like many other women, she thought that
if it was any pleasure or satisfaction to one who was
so dear to her, she would try to overlook it. When
they arrived at the house, they found Juliana,
who had been passing the afternoon there. As aunt
Nyna was not expecting Harry before she heard
of the ship’s arrival, of course she was greatly
surprised. But her surprise could not equal
Harry’s, when he found that the handsome and intelligent
young lady he met there, was the same
Juliana who formerly lived in the house with Hesper.
He had known her then, as a slovenly, disagreeable
girl, against whom he had felt the greatest
dislike.</p>

<p>“I declare!” he said, in a straight-forward
manner, as he stood and gazed at her&mdash;“I never
saw any one so altered in my life! and if you
won’t think me impudent, I will also add, or so
handsome either.”</p>

<p>A light blush quickly overspread Juliana’s countenance,
as she glanced smilingly up to him,
which made her appear more beautiful than ever.
After this Harry paid her great attention, and
when she became a little more acquainted, she
grew very social and entertaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>That night they all walked home together, loitering
along in the moonlight, engaged in pleasant
conversation, until they parted with Juliana at her
own door.</p>

<p>“I declare!” exclaimed Harry again, shortly
after leaving her, “what a beauty that girl is!
and how charming in conversation!”</p>

<p>“Yes!” replied Hesper earnestly, “and what is
best of all, she is good as she is handsome.”</p>

<p>She spoke most sincerely, for she loved Juliana
much, and the charity which thinketh no evil,
shut out all feelings of jealousy or suspicion from
her heart. Harry listened with much interest, as
Hesper proceeded at still greater length to set
forth the merits of Juliana, and at the conclusion,
he simply remarked, that he was glad Hesper had
so good a friend.</p>

<p>For the first two or three weeks after his arrival,
Harry was quite a constant visitor at the
residence of the Greysons, but when Hesper was
busy about the house, he usually took Juliana out
to ride, or sail, with him, and finally this became
so frequent, that the village gossips took the matter
up, and aunt Betsey came down to see about
it. To her surprise, however, she found that
Hesper did not feel anxious or troubled in the
least, and therefore she set herself to work immediately,
to make her so.</p>

<p>“I declare!” said she, after talking some time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
“I don’t see how you can be so quiet and calm
about it! Why, if it was me, I’d tear that girl’s
eyes out.”</p>

<p>“That would not mend the matter,” said Hesper,
carelessly. “If he likes her better than me,
let him take her&mdash;that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And do you mean to say, you wouldn’t care
one straw about it?” asked aunt Betsey.</p>

<p>“If I did, I shouldn’t tell any one,” said Hesper.</p>

<p>“But if you don’t look out for your rights in
time, you will be an old maid, certain.”</p>

<p>“Well, what if I am?” was the quiet reply;
“that will not hinder my usefulness.”</p>

<p>“Why Hesper Greyson!” exclaimed aunt Betsey.
“It’s a horrible disgrace to be an old maid!
I tell you, if I was a young girl, I would marry an
Esquimaux or a Hottentot, rather than be one!”</p>

<p>“And as for me,” replied Hesper, “I would
sooner lie down in my grave, than marry a man
whom I did not sincerely love, or who did not
thus love me.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied aunt Betsey, starting up,
“I see that you have some mighty fine ideas on
this subject. But let me tell you that if you
won’t look out for your own interest in time, and
turn out a poor, miserable old maid at last, you
needn’t look to my husband for assistance&mdash;that’s
all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>After thus relieving herself, she departed, leaving
Hesper in rather an uncomfortable frame of
mind. As matters continued, the poor girl herself
could not doubt much longer, and when, one
night, Harry came in and took his seat beside her,
she knew the instant she looked in his face, what
was the intention of his call as well as if he had
already spoken it.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” he said, after a short introductory
conversation, “I did think, when I came home,
that I loved you better than any one else in the
world, but now I know that I do not. I would
help it if I could, and if you say so, I will still
fulfil my promise, but I feel that with my heart
so divided, I could never make you truly happy.”</p>

<p>The color faded slightly from Hesper’s cheek,
and there was a scarcely perceptible tremor in her
voice, but she looked him calmly in the face and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Harry, if you love Juliana better than you do
me, marry her. You could not do yourself or me a
greater wrong, than in fulfilling an engagement
which you made under a mistaken impression. I
do not blame you in the least. Go your way and
be happy. You have my best wishes, and I shall
ever remain a friend to you and yours, so long as
life and breath are granted me.”</p>

<p>For a few moments Harry regarded her with
silent admiration. “Hesper,” he said, “you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a noble girl, and perhaps I shall live to repent the
step which I now take, in sackcloth and ashes.
But O!” he added, as he started up and clasped
her hand earnestly, “I cannot! indeed I cannot
help it! Think kindly of me, Hesper, and forgive
me.”</p>

<p>He pressed her hand to his lips, and turned
quickly away, leaving her alone with God and her
disappointment. She listened to the sound of his
footsteps as he went down the pathway, and then
falling upon her knees beside her chair, she wept
in agony of spirit. There was but one refuge for
her. The arms of Infinite Love were open to her,
and like a storm-beaten dove she cast herself into
them, as into an ark of safety, praying only that
the void in her heart might be filled with something
higher and holier than aught that earth
could give.</p>

<p>A few days after this, Juliana came, and with
tears in her eyes, opened her whole heart to Hesper.
She received as kind and considerate an
answer as that which had been given to Harry,
and she went away comforted in the thought that
by accepting his offer, she was not trampling on
the sacred rights of her friend.</p>

<p>In the course of a few weeks the new engagement
was made known, and everybody expressed
their astonishment. Hesper bore up bravely beneath
it. There was only one thing which deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
disturbed the serenity of her soul, and that was
the idle curiosity and most contemptible pity of
the village gossips. Aunt Betsey raved, and advised
Hesper to sue Harry for breach of promise,
directly.</p>

<p>There was one, however, to whom this unexpected
change was a cause of the deepest sorrow, and
this one was aunt Nyna herself.</p>

<p>“Hesper, my dear girl!” she said, as she came
one night, and putting her arm around her, drew
her close to her bosom&mdash;“I had hoped one day to
call thee my own child, but I feel it is ordered
otherwise. Between thee and me, I will say, that
I fear my Harry is not what he should be.
God bless thee, dear one! I trust that He in
whom there is neither variableness nor shadow of
turning, hath reserved for thee better things.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A HEART BLEEDING IN SECRET.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">There</span> was an unusually large wedding at the
Grimsbys, to which full half of the village was
invited, and Hesper too was there, looking more
beautiful than any one had ever seen her before.
She wore moss rose-buds in her hair and upon her
bosom, and her white dress, so floating and airy,
gave her a light, spiritual appearance, which accorded
well with the tender light in her eyes, and
the serenity of her pale countenance. When the
youthful pair stood up side by side, for the performance
of the ceremony, Hesper felt the painful
consciousness that as many eyes were turned upon
her, as on them. They were probing the depths
of her soul, to see how she bore her disappointment;
but that calm, sweet countenance, betrayed
nothing of the deep emotion within. Neither
could the slightest affectation or insincerity be detected
in her manner, when, at the conclusion of
the ceremony, she went forward with others, to
tender her congratulations and the kiss of affection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to the newly married pair. The time, however,
passed wearily to her, and feeling that she could
not bear the scrutiny of curious eyes much longer,
she retired at an early hour.</p>

<p>Alone in her little chamber once more, the feeling
of her desolation came upon her with over-powering
force. Still clothed in her wedding
garments, she sat by the open window, looking out
through the branches of the trees upon the distant
landscape which lay so bright and beautiful beneath
the summer moonlight. She held her
clasped hands over her heart with a sensation of
pain, and as the unnatural firmness to which she
had nerved herself gave way, the tears flowed
freely down her cheeks. Then she thought of
that land of peace, “where they neither marry nor
are given in marriage, but are as the angels of
God in heaven”&mdash;where “there is no more sorrow
or crying, but where tears are wiped from all
faces.” Never before had she felt such a yearning
to lay down her earthly garment and leave the
crushing cares of earth behind forever.</p>

<p>“O, that I had wings like a dove, that I might
flee away and be at rest,” she exclaimed, as with
tearful eyes she looked up to the cloudless heavens.
“Pitying Father, take thy poor heart-stricken
child to thyself!”</p>

<p>The air of the room seemed close and stifling to
her. She longed to be away upon the hill-tops or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in the woods, where she had so often wandered.
Acting from the impulse of the moment, she threw
her shawl around her, and stealing gently down
stairs, unbolted the door and passed out. Neither
knowing or caring whither she went, she pursued
her way with hurrying footsteps, till she came to
the village grave-yard.</p>

<p>“O,” she murmured, as she threw open the little
gate and entered the enclosure, “ye calm,
quiet sleepers, how sincerely do I wish that I too
was resting among you!” Then she stopped suddenly,
and pressed her hands to her forehead.</p>

<p>“How is it,” she added, in a calmer tone, “am
I beside myself, that at midnight I come hither
with such wishes upon my lips, because a selfish
sorrow has taken possession of my heart? Have
I not parents and friends, and all the world to live
for? and was life given us only to seek out our
individual interests, independent of all beside?
O, what a poor, miserable sinner I am!”</p>

<p>Weeping most sincerely over her own weakness
and folly, she passed on till she came to the little
marble tablet beneath which simple Johnny lay
buried. The sighing of the night winds through
the willows that grew near his grave, seemed like
the soft whisperings of his angel voice. She cast
herself with her face downward upon the green
mound that covered the child’s resting place, and
wept without restraint. How long she remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
thus she could not tell, for her very senses seemed
to pass away, and she lay there in a state of dreamy
unconsciousness. She only knew, that at last, a
gentle hand was laid upon her, and some one
called her name. Raising her head, she beheld
her mother close beside her.</p>

<p>“My child! my poor dear child!” said her
mother, “let me take you close into my bosom,
as I did when you were an infant, and comfort
you with my love.”</p>

<p>“Mother!” said Hesper, “how came you here?”</p>

<p>“I knew, poor child,” she replied, “that your
heart was bleeding in anguish, and therefore I
could not sleep. I heard you when you went
forth, and followed you hither, waiting a little way
off, till the first gush of sorrow had passed, for I
know by my own experience, that at such moments
it is better for the soul to be alone with its God.
O Hesper! my child! my child! I would to God
I could have borne this great grief for thee! but
it might not be. I know also, that it was well I
could not shield thee from this chastening of His
love. Bear up beneath it bravely and patiently,
my child, and in the end you shall see that He
ordereth all things well.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” said Hesper, “take me close
into your bosom, and let me warm myself upon
your loving heart, for greater than your daughter’s
sorrow, is a conscious sense of her own selfishness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and sin. I thank God in this hour of
trial that you are yet spared to me&mdash;that I have
your faithful bosom to shed my tears upon. I
have dared once in my life, mother, to lay plans
for my own future&mdash;to sketch a bright picture in
my imagination, all radiant with hopes of happiness
and selfish enjoyment, but I will do so no
longer. The vision has passed, and left me sadder
but wiser. I thank God for it! and here now,
upon this sacred altar of your heart, do I pledge
myself to live henceforth only for the good of
others. Strengthen me, mother, and pray for me,
lest my heart should fail me, for I am too weak to
pray for myself.”</p>

<p>They knelt down upon the mound together, and
the mother’s petition went up through the solemn
silence, beseeching most earnestly that a blessing
of strength and consolation might fall upon the
heart of her sorrowing child. Those two weak
women, kneeling at midnight in that lonely grave-yard,
had angel guardians whose help was greater
than that of man, and the words of prayer that
ascended from those trembling lips, was answered
by a blessing of peace, “such as the world can
neither give or take away.”</p>

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">LIVING FOR OTHERS.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">“Mother,”</span> said Hesper one day, after sitting in
thoughtful silence for some time, “I feel that I must
leave home and be doing something decided and
useful, or my energies will all rust out in idleness.
I have a good opportunity, too, and I think I ought
to improve it. Dr. Smiley informs me that a
teacher is wanting in the Institution for the Blind,
and he says he will secure me the situation at
once, if I desire it.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said her mother, “I hardly know
how we can do without you, my child. That is,
without your company, for it is true, that while
your father is doing so well, and I have my health,
that we really do not need you. But then I dread
to have you go out into the great world, for it is
cruel and cold, and has many sorrows for a young
and tender heart like yours.”</p>

<p>“And that is one great reason why I wish to go,
mother, for I desire to pass through the furnace,
that I may come out strong and pure at last. I
am ready for all things but idleness, that alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
burdens my spirit, and leaves me to weep over
sorrows that I cannot cure.”</p>

<p>“Well child,” said her mother. “I think you
are right. Act as your heart dictates, and have
no fear for the result.”</p>

<p>It was only a few weeks after this, that Hesper
gave her parting kiss to her friends, and stepping
into the stage coach, bade her home farewell for
the first time. She felt like a lone bird cast out
upon the world, but the strong purpose in her
heart sustained her, and she entered upon the duties
of her responsible position without fear. At
first, with her home sickness and heart sickness,
it was a hard struggle, and she feared she should
sink beneath it, but she persevered, and gradually
her new employment became to her a matter of
all-absorbing interest.</p>

<p>The little blind children came with their soft
hands and gentle touch, and traced out feature by
feature of her face, that they might form a picture
in their minds, of her they had learned to
love so well. They were soon able to distinguish
her footsteps from all others, and her voice seemed
like music to their ears. Her sympathy became
a necessary thing to the happiness of these youthful
unfortunates, and her name was an oft repeated
word in their prayers. Gradually the peace
that passeth all understanding found an abiding
place in her soul, and diffused its serene light over
her whole countenance. There was something indescribable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in her mien and manner, which drew
all hearts after her, and Hesper Greyson, with her
meekness and humility, became at length what
she had earnestly desired to be:&mdash;“A high, pure
star, to herald on the weary to the land of rest.”
She had learned to live above self, and had consecrated
all her powers, without reserve, to the
service of others. For one whole year she devoted
herself most faithfully to the performance of her duties
at the Institution, only accepting, at long intervals,
the privilege of a few days to look in upon the
loved ones at home. At the end of this year, however,
she was to have a vacation of some two or three
weeks. She had received intelligence that Mose had
arrived, and also during her stay at home, he and
Alice were to unite their destinies for life, therefore
she looked forward with no slight interest to
this interval of rest. She also determined, that
upon her way home, she would pass through the
city, and spend one night with her old friends,
Harry and Juliana, for they had left home shortly
after their marriage, and she had not seen them
since&mdash;indeed, had only heard from them, except
by an occasional letter from Juliana, in which she
besought Hesper most earnestly to come and make
her a visit.</p>

<p>It was an affecting scene to look upon, when
the little blind children gathered around her, as
she stood in the hall, ready for her departure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Some clasped their loving arms about her, and imprinted
warm kisses of farewell upon her cheeks,
while others “fell upon her neck and wept sore,”
as if their sorrow-stricken hearts already had a
presentiment that their beloved teacher would return
to them no more.</p>

<p>It was about sunset when Hesper arrived at the
residence of her friends in the city. Her ring at
the door was answered by Juliana herself, with an
infant in her arms. She seemed overjoyed at the
sight of Hesper, but Hesper, in return, could only
gaze at her friend in silent astonishment, for a
most wonderful change had come over her. The
dazzling beauty which had once rendered her an
object of such general admiration, had all faded
away, leaving her face pale and careworn, and in
her once brilliant eyes, there was a look of weariness
and disappointment, which betrayed a hidden
source of sorrow within.</p>

<p>“I am as glad to see you, Hesper,” she said,
“as if you were an angel from heaven, for I have
hushed up my heart-aches as long as I can bear
them, and now I want to pour them all out into
your friendly bosom. You were always full of
sympathy and love, and I know you are no less so
now. How calm and peaceful you look, Hesper,
as though you had been thinking of nothing but
God and heavenly things ever since I saw you last&mdash;while
I&mdash;O dear!”&mdash;and bowing her head to
the face of her sleeping child, she burst into tears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Hesper put her arm tenderly around her, and laid
her soft cheek to that of her weeping friend.</p>

<p>“You may thank heaven, Hesper,” continued
Juliana, “that Harry didn’t marry you, for if he
had, you would have been just where I am now.
No,” she added quickly, “you would have made a
man of him, but it isn’t in me to do that. I
haven’t either the faith or patience; but, to speak
plain, I get outrageously mad when Harry makes
a fool of himself, and I let him know it, too.
There’s nothing to do then, but to take it out in
quarrelling, and so we have it hot and heavy sometimes,
I can tell you. It is only about six months
now, since he fell into bad company and evil ways,
but if that six months is a specimen of what I am
to expect, I hope I may be in my grave before the
end of another week.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be discouraged, Juliana,” said Hesper,
kindly&mdash;“Harry has a good spot left yet in his
heart, and the ‘charity that never faileth’ may
save him, even now, from destruction.”</p>

<p>“Hesper Greyson!” exclaimed Juliana, “I
never saw any one like you in my life. I believe
you would try to reform Satan himself by the
power of love, if you only had the opportunity.
But then it is one thing to say, and another
to do, and if you were only in my place for a little
while, I believe you would give up all such
thoughts forever, and grow desperate like myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“I would accomplish my work, or die,” said
Hesper&mdash;“more especially, if I had a little one
like that, to link me to the one who should be a
true and loving father to it.”</p>

<p>“My poor little baby!” said Juliana, as she
pressed the child more closely to her bosom; “for
his sake alone I have kept back many a hard word
and unkindly feeling, for O! it seems a dreadful
thing to think of a tender little one growing up
after the example of such a father. Yes, for the
baby’s sake, if not for my own, I would do all that
lay in my power to reform Harry,” and she wept
without restraint.</p>

<p>The tea hour came and went, but Harry did not
make his appearance, and it was not till a late
hour that he sought his home. Then it was evident
that he was no longer master of himself, for,
upon entering, he staggered across the room without
recognizing Hesper, and fell down, all in a
heap, near the sofa, upon which he had intended
to throw himself. Juliana turned deadly pale, and
bit her lips together with a look of desperation.</p>

<p>“There, Hesper,” she said, “what would you
do, if that was your husband?”</p>

<p>“I should wait until he was sober, and then
plead with him as only a loving wife and mother
can. Did you ever try it, Juliana?”</p>

<p>“No! never! The first time he came home
thus, I could not find words to express my indignation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
I told him that I utterly despised him,
and for days not a word passed between us; but,
O Hesper! they were the most miserable days of
my life. I thought they would kill me. I would
do anything rather than experience the like again,
for I love him yet, and cannot bear to give him
up.”</p>

<p>“Then tell him so,” said Hesper, “and prove it
by all your actions. I tell you his nature cannot
long stand out against it. Many a worse man has
been reformed by a true woman’s love.”</p>

<p>Juliana laid her child in the cradle, and taking
a pillow, she placed it at one end of the sofa.</p>

<p>“Hesper,” she said, “take hold of Harry’s feet,
will you, and help me lift him upon the sofa?”
Hesper immediately complied with her request,
and the work was accomplished with little difficulty,
for he made no resistance.</p>

<p>“There, now, Hesper,” said Juliana, in a calm,
resolute tone&mdash;“let me show you to your chamber.
As for me, I shall sit by my drunken husband
through the night, and if morning brings
him back to his reason&mdash;God helping me, I will
speak to him as I have never done before.”</p>

<p>It was long past midnight ere Hesper closed her
eyes in sleep, for her heart was full of sympathy
for her friend. She was very weary, however, and
therefore did not waken again, till the morning
sun was shining brightly into her window, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
jostle and tumult of city life had fully commenced
in the street below. Arraying herself in haste,
she stole quietly to the head of the stairs. She
could hear the sound of voices engaged in earnest
conversation below, and therefore she did not go
down. A full half hour longer she waited, and
then descended to the parlor. Upon entering the
room she found Juliana seated beside her husband
on the sofa, with her sleeping child in her arms.
Harry’s arm was around her, and her head rested
upon his bosom. He was very pale indeed, and
it was evident that both had been weeping.</p>

<p>“Come hither, Hesper,” said Harry, in a voice
tremulous with emotion, as he extended his hand
towards her, “you see me here, completely conquered.
Strong man as I am, I have become weak
as a little child before this woman’s love. O Hesper!
if there is anything that will save me from
destruction, it is that!” and pressing his wife
more closely to his bosom, he kissed her with unfeigned
affection. Hesper knelt down beside them,
and took their clasped hands in her own.</p>

<p>“Pray for me,” said Harry, “for your prayers,
I feel assured, will find acceptance before heaven.”
And Hesper did pray, with all the fervent earnestness
of her soul, till it seemed as though the very
presence of the Lord was in their midst. Harry
was deeply moved, and as she concluded, he drew
the hands of the two weeping women into his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Be my witnesses this day,” he said, “as I
solemnly pledge myself, before God and His
angels, henceforth to avoid all intoxicating drinks
and evil association. And I will also strive, as far
as in me lies, to become a faithful husband and
father, and a useful member in society. Whatever
my weaknesses or follies are, or may have
been, I never was guilty of untruthfulness, therefore
you may consider the resolution which I take
now, as unchangeable.” A bright, joyful smile
beamed over Juliana’s countenance, as she looked
up to him with an expression of perfect confidence
and love.</p>

<p>“It is enough, Harry,” she said, “and I also
will promise that you shall never want for love or
patience upon my part, to encourage you in your
way.”</p>

<p>A few hours after this, Hesper had once more
started upon her homeward journey, and on her
arrival, found not only Mose in waiting for her,
but also his friend, Mr. Clyde, who had returned
from his European tour, and was intending to stop
with the family until after the expected marriage.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE EVENING STAR.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">“Hesper,”</span> said aunt Betsey, as she dropped in
one afternoon with her knitting, “has that Mr.
Clyde come a courting?”</p>

<p>“Come a courting!” repeated Hesper&mdash;(using
an expression which she greatly disliked)&mdash;“who?”</p>

<p>“Why you, to be sure,” said aunt Betsey. “I
asked for information, because, if he has, I should
like to know for a very particular reason.”</p>

<p>“Well, no,” said Hesper, “he merely came to
see Mose, and only intends remaining till after the
marriage.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! I’m sorry,” said aunt Betsey, “for,
Hesper, I tell you the truth&mdash;I verily believe you
will be an old maid, and if you don’t talk up to
Mr. Clyde or somebody, pretty soon, it will be a
gone case with you.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” replied Hesper&mdash;“if it depends
upon my making the first advances, my fate is
already decided, and my case hopeless, for I never
shall offer myself directly or indirectly to any
man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>“But,” said aunt Betsey, after a few moment’s
thoughtful silence&mdash;“if you should change your
mind, and Mr. Clyde or some one else should offer
himself, do let me know in time, for that satin
bed-quilt of mine, is packed away in the attic,
with a whole chest full of other clothes, and I
want to get it down to shake, and brush, and air
it as it should be, before I make you a present of
it; for I never shall do the least thing in the
world with it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hesper, “I will let you know in
time;” and with this promise aunt Betsey seemed
perfectly contented. She looked very graciously
over her spectacles at Mr. Clyde, when he came
in, and in the course of conversation, took occasion
to remark that she thought Hesper had
improved wonderfully during her absence from
home. She was most unusually condescending and
amiable, and when she arose to depart, she remarked
that she should call often while Mr. Clyde
was there, as she enjoyed the conversation of such
intelligent people very much.</p>

<p>There was a glorious sunset that evening. The
whole western sky seemed all a blaze with the
gold and crimson splendors of the King of Day.
The trees and the green hill-tops were glowing
with the radiant light, and the ocean, in its waveless
calm, reflecting back the brightness of the
heavens, seemed like a molten sea of gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, Hesper,” said Mr. Clyde, “let us go
along the brook side, and climb up the old rock,
where we can watch these sunset fires die out on
Nature’s altar.”</p>

<p>“Ah! this makes me think of old Italy!” he
said, as they wandered along the forest path&mdash;“fair
Italy! And yet, with all the splendor and
beauty of that favored clime, which I have so often
gazed upon, this scene is dearer far to me, because
it is my own native land.”</p>

<p>“There is no place like home, after all, Hesper,”
he added, as he put forth his arm to aid her up the
steep ascent; “I cannot tell you how often my
heart turned back with an unutterable yearning to
these shores, and even to this very spot, where I
saw you last, weaving violets and green leaves
together, while the lights and shadows through
the forest boughs were playing across your countenance.”</p>

<p>“You have changed very much since then,” he
continued, as he looked her thoughtfully in the
face. “You are less of the child, and more of the
woman now, in experience. There is a soft and
chastened expression upon every feature, and in
your eyes a deep, spiritual light, such as can only
come through a long and trying discipline of sorrow.
O Hesper, you and I both know what it is
to pass under the shadow of a great and desolating
grief, but your soul has come out chastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and purified by the trial, while mine still lingers in
darkness and unreconciliation. My very existence,
as it creeps slowly onward, day by day, has
become a wearisome burden&mdash;- for what is the
future without hope, or life without love?”</p>

<p>“Let us not think of such things,” said Hesper,
gently, “for the heart cannot forget its bitterness
while memory continually renews its grief. Beyond
and around us all, lie sweetly harmonizing influences,
which we can draw into our hearts if we
will, and soothe all discordant murmurings to rest.”</p>

<p>“See yonder,” she continued, “where the
evening star looks brightly forth amid the fading
glories of the sunset. The twilight will deepen, and
the evening shadows prevail, but that star will grow
brighter and brighter, until at length it will be the
fairest object to which the eye of the way-worn
and weary will turn. Thus is it with the patient,
persevering heart; the shadows of life may deepen
and darken around it, but its light grows clearer
and brighter, until it becomes a guiding star of
peace to many a troubled spirit. God grant,
friend, that such a high and holy mission may be
yours!”</p>

<p>“Not mine, but yours, good angel,” said Mr.
Clyde, as he turned towards her; “it is already
yours. Three years ago, as we sat together at the
foot of this rock, you bade me go forth to the
world and live for the sake of others as far as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
me lay, and I did so, and all the peace I have experienced
has come through that channel alone.
Now, as if an emblem of our own spiritual progress,
we meet again, not at the foot, but at the
summit of the rock; yet over me the shadows are
still brooding. O Hesper! star of peace and
never failing charity, send down the light of thy
love into the darkened depths of my heart!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he drew her, like a frightened
dove, close to his bosom. For one moment she
shrank and trembled, and then, with all the loving
gratitude of her nature, she accepted this strong
refuge from her loneliness and sorrow. Far off, in
the distant woods, the whip-poor-will sung his
plaintive song, and the soft rippling brook made
sweet music below. The evening star looked
mildly from the western sky, and all nature with
mute sympathy, seemed to mingle in their joy, but
no eye, save those of God and his angels, witnessed
the consecration of these two faithful hearts. One
week after this, there was a double wedding at the
doctor’s, against which no disapproving word was
spoken, for the village gossips entered by mutual
agreement into a treaty of peace, on account of
the general invitation that was extended. Aunt
Betsey’s countenance was wreathed with smiles of
satisfaction, and Mr. Byers, who always had an
eye to business, retired to a corner, and covered
several pages of his note book with wise remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and philosophical conclusions, which the occasion
had called forth.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Dorothy,” he said to aunt Nyna, very
privately, when a convenient opportunity offered,
“I think that the example of these young people
is worthy of all imitation, and I feel, moreover,
that considering our lonely condition, it behooveth
both you and I, that we mutually agree to go and
do likewise.”</p>

<p>“Yea, verily, friend,” replied the good lady, in
her usual quiet manner, “thee hast spoken my
mind exactly;” and from that time forth the matter
was decided.</p>

<p>Years have intervened since then, but even now,
in a pleasant cottage by the brook, where the
spring flowers bloom earliest and the autumn
leaves are last to fall, dwells Hesper, the Home
Spirit, for her mission is not yet ended. Joyful
little ones, with dancing feet and smiling countenances,
come and go over the threshold, and he
who chose that star of peace as the guide to his
earthly pathway, still walks by her serene light,
rejoicing in a “love that never faileth.”</p>
